1mzzoql,Would you use an Airtable extension to compare 2 tables or Airtable ‚Üî CSV?,"Hi All, 


I often see people struggle with comparing datasets inside Airtable (like checking differences between 2 tables, or Airtable vs an external CSV/Google Sheet).

I‚Äôm exploring building an Airtable extension/that:

* Lets you pick two tables (or table + CSV).
* Choose match fields (e.g., invoice ID, email).
* Highlights matches, mismatches, missing records.
* Exports a reconciliation/diff report.

Use cases I‚Äôve heard:

* Finance teams ‚Üí bank vs ledger.
* Ops/logistics ‚Üí shipments vs deliveries.
* Sales/CRM ‚Üí client list vs actual leads.

Question: 

Is this a pain you‚Äôve faced?

It's built by an Airtable power-user, for Airtable power-users! The tech stack is Next.JS, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS on the front-end, n8n on the back-end, and PostgreSQL on the database layer.I spent a lot of time on UX, design, and making it intuitive and useful so hopefully its reflected if/when using it. The product is like a mini version of¬†***Github and Datadog, but for Airtable.***¬†(version control, observability, monitoring, historical tracking, analytics).¬† You basically add a script to any Airtable base, and it'll track all of your schema changes through time (table creation/deletions, field creations/deletions, changing the condition of a field, the text, the choices, table view changes, etc)Some of the things you can do:  


* Generate a developer style Changelog of all of the schema changes over you did on a base over the last day, week, month, etc. (Export it in .md, .json, .txt)
* Export the current state of an Airtable base today, or what it was 2 weeks ago to debug something that broke automation, a formula, etc.
* Or export the current base in Markdown so that you can upload the schema into ChatGPT, Claude, another LLM so it can get the full context of the base you're working on instantly!
* Review all of your bases that you're tracking visually to see if major changes have been made at a high level over the past week.
* See the growth of a bases's tables, fields, record count through time.
* Find what the configuration for some of your field's formulas, or Airtable AI agent's prompts were over the last few weeks or iterations.

‚Ä¢  Users scroll through Twitter, YouTube videos, LinkedIn, Instagram, websites, etc. ‚Ä¢  They encounter inspiring content. ‚Ä¢  The user copies the URL, takes a screenshot, or similar. ‚Ä¢  They run a shortcut on iOS (e.g., double-tap on the back of the phone for convenience) or pass the URL via Telegram. ‚Ä¢  The solution processes the URL: extracts tweet content and author, gets YouTube transcriptions, scrapes websites, etc. ‚Ä¢  It saves the extracted content in Notion/airtable and categorizes it automatically. Potential additional features: ‚Ä¢  Interact with your saved resources via Telegram, an app, or another interface using AI. ‚Ä¢  Generate reports or excerpts of what you found interesting, and more.

I‚Äôve already worked out the logic for this solution, and I‚Äôll finish a beta version this week.

Anyone interested in testing? Please DM me or leave a comment, and I‚Äôll reach out. I‚Äôll probably launch a waitlist today.

1msdbnu,Complete Novice Question,"Hello,

I'm really new to this so I apologise if I explain this poorly.

Essentially, I'd like one main table to be a list of all the items I plan on purchasing, kind of like a shopping list.  With that said, I have a lot of single items that are just miscellaneous that I want to add by hand to the ""main"" table, but I also have bigger projects with their own needs that I want to have added to the ""main"" table automatically.

For example, when building a new PC I'd like to be able to create a ""PC"" table with its own own unique fields.  I'd then like for the name of each item added, and perhaps one field or two (such as a ""price"" field) that's already in the ""main"" table to be carried over.  I have an example of this below.

I assume I could do something like this with just one large table and just using views, but I'd really like for them to have their own tables so that I can keep it more organized and more easily create these sub-lists so to speak, and so that I don't have to worry with making sure each one is marked as ""car parts"" or ""pc parts"" in a category, etc.

Again I apologise for being a newb, I hope this made sense.

Also I know the rule said to include screenshots, but I don't know how to screenshot it since I don't know how to do it, instead I just put table examples of what I'm hoping to achieve.  I hope this is okay.

Thank you.

Car Parts Table:

|| || |Car Parts 1|Price|Unique Car Field| |Car Parts 2|Price|Unique Car Field| |Car Parts 3|Price|Unique Car Field|

\---

Edit:  The tables didn't seem to come out well, so I just took screenshots of sort of what I'm hoping for.  Basically it's having multiple different tables, with different parameters, and just mirroring the name table for each entry into the ""main"" table without having to manually check extra boxes or add them, etc.  Basically automatically creating linked ""Name"" entries in ""Main"" table from other tables.

Basically something like this, so every time a new ""car"" or ""PC"" record is created, it creates a ""main"" with a linked name and price (even though in that diagram example I left out the PC and car prices that would feed into the main as well).

EDIT - **SOLUTION**

After several days of iterations and help of ChatGPT I finally got an automation setup that works:

\---

Airtable doesn‚Äôt do ‚Äúlive mirroring‚Äù out of the box, but you can get close with **Automations + Update records**. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step for your exact case:

# Step 1: Make sure your tables are set up

* **Main** table:
   * `Main Name` (Single line text)
   * `Main Price` (Currency or number)
* **Cigars** table:
   * `Cigar Name`
   * `Cigar Price`
   * `Include in Main` (Checkbox)
   * (Optional helper field, see step 6)

# Step 2: Create the automation trigger

1. Go to **Automations** (top bar ‚Üí Automations).
2. Click **Create automation**.
3. Choose **Trigger: When record matches conditions**.
4. Select the **Cigars** table.
5. Condition: `Include in Main` **is checked**.

This ensures it only fires when you check the box.

# Step 3: Add action to create a record in Main

1. Add **Action: Create record**.
2. Table = **Main**.
3. Map fields:
   * `Main Name` ‚Üí `Cigar Name`
   * `Main Price` ‚Üí `Cigar Price`

This creates the Main entry.

# Step 4: Keep them in sync

To update changes, you‚Äôll need a **way to know which Main record belongs to which Cigar**.  
Do this by adding a ‚Äúback reference‚Äù:

1. In **Cigars**, add a field `Main Record ID` (single line text).
2. In your automation (the same one in Step 3), after the **Create record** action, add another action:
   * **Update record** in **Cigars**.
   * Record ID = from the trigger.
   * Set `Main Record ID` = **Record ID** of the Main record just created.

Now each cigar knows which Main row belongs to it.

# Step 5: Automation for updates

1. Create another automation.
2. **Trigger: When record updated** in **Cigars**.
   * Watch fields: `Cigar Name`, `Cigar Price`.
   * Add condition: `Include in Main` is checked.
3. **Action: Update record** in **Main**.
   * Record ID = `Main Record ID` (from the cigar).
   * Map fields:
      * `Main Name` ‚Üí `Cigar Name`
      * `Main Price` ‚Üí `Cigar Price`

This keeps them in sync whenever you change the cigar.

# Step 6 (optional but recommended): Prevent duplicates

* Modify the first automation trigger (Step 2) to also check that `Main Record ID` **is empty**.
* That way, if you uncheck/recheck, it won‚Äôt create duplicate Main entries.

‚úÖ Result:

* Checking ‚ÄúInclude in Main‚Äù creates a matching Main record.
* Any edits to Cigar Name/Price automatically update the linked Main record.
* Each cigar keeps track of which Main record belongs to it.

\---

Thank you everyone for the help.

* Someone changes a field type or deletes a column ‚Üí automations break, API calls fail, and dashboards go blank.
* For small teams or agencies (especially not on Enterprise), there‚Äôs no real safety net when this happens.

I‚Äôve been exploring the idea of a lightweight watchdog called **SchemaGuard**:

* Tracks schema versions (tables, fields, types)
* Alerts you if a breaking change happens
* Keeps a changelog of who/what/when
* (Optionally) adds guardrails like conflict detection before syncs break

A couple of questions for you:

* Has schema breakage ever caused issues in your setup?
* How do you currently catch or prevent it?
* Do you feel Airtable‚Äôs built-in tools already solve this, or would something like SchemaGuard be useful?

1mp0gxf,Airtable Comments are annoying - here's how to fix them.,"**Wouldn't it be cool if when someone comments / tags me on an airtable record, I can automate a notification to a Slack / Whatsapp Group? Turns out you can, free tool below** üëá

A partner recently told me, ""did you see the comment I left on X record?"" The answer was no, and of course it was no because:
- I don't spend my day browsing for comments
- How can I not miss the tiny notification on the top bar

**The Problem**

- **API only allows listing comments for individual records, not base-wide** - You have to get every single record, then crawl through each record's comments
- **Can't filter by date** - You need to return everything and filter yourself. If you thought Airtable would give you a way to get all comments sent after X date, think again
- **No-code becomes expensive** - For example, using Make.com running 3 times daily on a 2000-record base, 20 days/month:

        2000 x 3 x 20 = 120,000 operations = ~$120+/month just to work with your own comments!

**The Solution**

Since we're forced to use code, I built a simple Python tool that gets all comments on your bases or specific records, and prints them separated by table.

**Github Repo** (Use it as you please): https://github.com/eduardocg02/airtable-comments-template

Use `get_all_comments` or `get_all_comments_fast` (4-6x faster) to get all comments, or `get_comment` for a specific record.

**Easy Setup**

Provide your Airtable API Key & Base ID, and you're ready to go. More detailed info with examples on the link.

**Is it Perfect?**

No, it's a quick tool I AI-coded in 20 minutes to build upon. From here you can add filtering logic for which comments trigger what notifications, connect it to Webhooks for Slack/WhatsApp and host it on a server so it's always running (Recommend a FastAPI service on Railway).

1moa6ag,Question in Interface Chart - duo axis,"Hi there, 

In my interface I‚Äôm using a chart with duo axis. Left axis shows consumption per month with a bar. Right axis shows threshold per month in a line. This gives me quick insight if consumption per month stays within the threshold.

Issue: I cannot or do not know how default the max value. So eg, threshold is max 5, so right axis goes to 5. Consumption has been max 4, so left axis goes up to 4. What happens, values are not aligned and with a consumption of 4 it actually looks like it‚Äôs on par with the threshold‚Ä¶ 

Does anyone know a fix? In ppt it‚Äôs as easy as setting a max with steps of x value‚Ä¶

1ml7bon,Slack Notifications for Airtable Outages,"I'm sharing how we push notifications of Airtable outages to Slack for fast updates.

As you may be aware, Airtable has an outage status page here: [https://status.airtable.com/](https://status.airtable.com/)

You can subscribe to these by email. We took it one step further by pushing those emails to an Airtable automation, then sending a Slack notification with summary info.

**Subscribing the Automation**

First we'll need to create an automation with the trigger ""when email received."" This can be in any base you want - we won't even be creating any records.

This provides an inboard email address like this

https://preview.redd.it/2zgezzk60vhf1.png?width=465&format=png&auto=webp&s=a40833ce37fab1759a462ec7f912febe9f140e53

Copy this email and subscribe on [https://status.airtable.com/](https://status.airtable.com/)

Now, we need to authorize the email. Go back to the automation and click 'Test trigger."" You should see the confirmation email in the sample data. Expand the body section and you'll find the confirmation URL. 

https://preview.redd.it/o1c8e4an0vhf1.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=57184d9ee89a65802b549e8330e629d04871465f

Highlight the URL and copy (Ctrl + C) and paste into your browser. (The preview box collapses, but you can still copy.)

**Setting Up Script**

The next step unfortunately you have to wait until an actual outage occurs and an email is sent. You need to test the automation using the real outage email body before it can be turned on. However, I'll share the setup below.

The body of outage emails is a bit lengthy and redundant. My next step is to run a script to extract the info I actually want to send in Slack. Also, because an outage can have multiple update emails, we've chosen to only send an alert when a new incident occurs and when the incident is resolved.

Below is my script:

    //¬†Config
    let¬†inputConfig¬†=¬†input.config();
    let¬†subject¬†=¬†inputConfig.subject;
    let¬†body¬†=¬†inputConfig.body;
    
    console.log(body)
    
    //¬†Trim¬†message¬†to¬†key¬†text
    let¬†index¬†=¬†body.indexOf(""Time¬†posted"");
    let¬†message¬†=¬†index¬†!==¬†-1¬†?¬†body.substring(0,¬†index).trim()¬†:¬†body;
    let¬†lines¬†=¬†message.split('\n');
    lines.shift();
    let¬†trimMessage¬†=¬†lines.join('\n').trim();
    
    //¬†Set¬†outputs
    if¬†(message.includes(""New¬†incident""))¬†{
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†output.set('type',¬†'new');
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†output.set('subject',¬†subject);
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†output.set('message',¬†trimMessage);
    }¬†else¬†if¬†(message.includes(""Incident¬†resolved""))¬†{
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†output.set('type',¬†'resolved');
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†output.set('subject',¬†subject);
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†output.set('message',¬†trimMessage);
    }

* I like to log the body just for troubleshooting.
* I'm keeping only the text before ""Time posted"" which is consistently in the outage emails.
* I only create outputs for new and resolved cases.

In the script step, remember to set the inputs on the left:

https://preview.redd.it/rsbj2c772vhf1.png?width=357&format=png&auto=webp&s=98220228d8b9646e8a24b5e8676ecc4f9c6e9144

Now you have to wait for an outage to occur so you can test the script using a real email body and product outputs. They will look something like this:

https://preview.redd.it/pn3ul1452vhf1.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1a20ae8c399e4a868d36ec45c04a90b480d061d

**Setting Up Slack**

Now I have conditional logic based on the 'type' output

You can set up the Slack notification however you want. I found this looks nice for new and resolved notifications:

1mh78jk,Help with CSV export to round-out app.,"Hello! 

I've been working on a project that takes a csv file from the user, runs it through Airtable to apply edits to the data, and then return the data to the user as a CSV file. I've managed to get user data in and edited but now I'm running into trouble on how to approach the last and most crucial part of getting the data back to the end user. 

For getting the right data:

 \- Every upload from the user has a unique user ID and Session ID which keeps data where it should be in the event of an export.   
 \- Fail-safes are implemented to catch any errors or oddities in the ID system

For exporting - 

I'm honestly not sure what I should do at the moment but I'd like the simplest solution first:, a couple ideas I have had are:

\- Dynamic Filters as upload sessions complete that then export the view as a CSV to an email attachment via Automations and Airtable Scripting.

\- Utilizing Airtable and an Email API to pull the data from base and create a CSV with it, then attach it to the email

\- Airtable API and some sort of hosting solution with an export.

1merw26,Problem getting correct information displayed in interface,"**ETA:** I have now managed to solve this. I tried using Claude rather than ChatGPT but that didn't help much. In the end I gave up usng Airtable's automation tools and instead got Claude to write me a script which worked almost immediately, bar a tiny bit of tinkering. Suffice to say it was a much simpler solution than the one ChatGPT initially recommended which involved multiple views, tables and automations.

However, if anyone does know how to solve the problem below using AT's native automation I'm very interested to hear. Thanks

\---------

I have an interface that is a dashboard. Among other things it pulls in a variety of numbers from different places in my base. I'm having a real headache pulling in one particular number.

It is a ¬£ value in a field called 'Revenue left to find'. It is essentially how much new business we need to achieve to hit budget.

The number sits in a table called 'Performance'.

Every couple of weeks we go in and create a new record which has 'Date' and 'Added revenue', The automation then works out 'total revenue added this year' and the number I want 'Revenue left to find'.

All I want to do is automatically pull through the latest 'Revenue left to find' into an interface. Turns out this is much harder than it should be.

In my initial setup I managed it by setting up the interface so it pulled through the lowest number in the field 'Revenue left to find'. The problem is, we've just increased our budget, so for the first time the latest amount in 'Revenue left to find' is not the lowest number in that field.

1mbivpn,Seeking Advice: Building a CRM for a Car Brokerage in Airtable (with SMS/Email Automations),"Hey everyone ‚Äî hoping someone here can point me in the right direction or share best practices.

I‚Äôve used Airtable in the past (a while ago), and I believe it‚Äôs the perfect platform for a project I‚Äôm currently helping with. I‚Äôm not a developer, but I‚Äôm very tech-savvy and extremely comfortable with systems like Airtable and Google Sheets. I also have a strong grasp of workflows, formulas, and logic-based automations.



# üöó The Project: Car Brokerage CRM

I‚Äôm helping a friend who runs a **car brokerage business** ‚Äî he helps clients lease or purchase new vehicles (mostly leases). His business is all about offering **white-glove service** and a much more convenient alternative to going to a dealership.

Right now, all his client info is managed in **Google Sheets**, but it‚Äôs becoming hard to scale and track workflows as his volume grows. That‚Äôs where Airtable comes in.



**üìä What We‚Äôre Trying to Build**

The goal is to **recreate and improve** his current sheet inside Airtable, with automation and CRM-like functionality. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

* **Client Database:** We‚Äôll track basic info like contact details, vehicle preferences, lease/purchase type, and key dates (start date, lease term, end date, etc.).
* **Automated Triggers:** Many of the fields are date-driven. We‚Äôd like to set up **automations** based on lease end dates ‚Äî for example:
   * If a client‚Äôs lease ends in 60 days, trigger an **SMS or email reminder** to both the client and the broker to begin renewal or replacement discussions.
   * Optionally, queue up additional follow-ups at 30 days and 10 days.
* **SMS & Email Integration:** I have **Twilio** set up for SMS, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions if anyone has a better or easier integration recommendation.
* **Custom Views & Status Tracking:** Ideally, we‚Äôd like different views for:
   * Active clients
   * Upcoming lease expirations
   * Recently closed deals
   * Referrals and follow-ups

# üîß My Main Questions

1. **Templates vs. Building From Scratch:**Is there a **template** or starter base anyone recommends for something like this (CRM, deal tracker, leasing funnel, etc.) ‚Äî or would you suggest starting from a blank table?
2. **Best Practices for Lease Tracking:**What‚Äôs the best way to calculate and trigger reminders for lease expirations based on start date + lease term in months?
3. **Twilio Automation Tips:**Anyone have sample setups or tips for using **Twilio with Airtable Automations**, especially for dynamic SMS content (e.g. including client name, lease info, etc.)?
4. **Other Integrations or Tools to Consider:**I‚Äôm also exploring using **Make (Integromat)** or **Zapier** if needed ‚Äî but would love suggestions on clean, reliable ways to build a low-code solution with maximum flexibility.

Any insights, feedback, or examples would be hugely appreciated üôè

Would love to see what others have done with similar use cases ‚Äî even screenshots or base links (with dummy data) would be a huge help.

1m87nrb,CollabPortals - quick and easy Airtable portal for managing external user data,"**What is it?**

[CollabPortals](https://www.collabportals.com) is an easy way to create Airtable portals where clients, freelancers, suppliers, and other collaborators can securely view, submit, and update records from your Airtable base ‚Äî with full control over what they can access.

  
**Why did we make it?**

We love using Airtable to manage our supplier data, and often collect data using Airtable forms. However we quickly realised it would be helpful if suppliers could go back and view/edit their form submissions.

We struggled to find solutions that were cost effective and easy to use for this purpose. Airtable portals are expensive, nocode portal builders have a learning curve and can also be costly due to bundling features we didn‚Äôt require, as well as user based pricing.

So we built CollabPortals for this specific purpose, and are charging only $10 per month for unlimited portals and collaborators.



**Features:**

* Instant portal for external partners to manage their data.
* Your users don‚Äôt need an Airtable account: we handle login, using emails stored on your base.
* Full control over which tables and fields they can see and edit.
* Instant Airtable sync, we don‚Äôt store any data, we just provide a UI for your Airtable.



**Benefits:**

* Very cost effective, no user-based pricing, unlimited portals and users for $10 per month
* Simple to set up. You can have a portal live in a few clicks, then it‚Äôs just a case of adjusting which fields they can see



**CollabPortals is for you if:**

* You have external partners that need to submit and update data, for example customers, clients, vendors, suppliers, freelancers, students, parents of students, etc!
* You want to solve this problem with learning a complicated new app
* You have a decent number of users so user based pricing is out of the window



**CollabPortals is** ***not*** **for you if:**

* You need highly customisable UIs & specific requirements - best to use a nocode portal builder

1m7h9ih,Say Goodbye to Airtable API Limits with This Google Sheets Hack,"Hey everyone üëã

If you've ever run into Airtable API limits or just need a faster way to access your base data regularly, I‚Äôve put together a simple workflow that might help.

Using¬†[**CSV Getter**](https://www.csvgetter.com/), you can¬†**sync your Airtable base to a Google Sheet**¬†on a schedule.  
  
**Results:**  
‚úÖ Faster access to your data  
‚úÖ Fewer Airtable API calls  
‚úÖ Automatic backups in Google Sheets

The Google Sheet acts like a¬†**proxy API.**¬†You can use it for lightweight querying or integrations, without constantly hitting the Airtable API.

* A client should see just their records ‚Äî but interfaces don‚Äôt fully support that
* You want login + permissions ‚Äî but end up stitching together synced views, filters, and automations

1m3zp2y,Logging schema changes in Airtable base,"Hi! A week ago or so I've posted here that I'm experimenting with creating an airtable base documentation website that updates itself and stays up to date.

I realised that for that I need to be able to observe changes in the Airtable base well so I've created this logging / observing service.

Technically it's not that novel, it builds on top of the API webhooks which can fire on any schema change and it pretty formats the result into markdown and passes it to an Airtable table.

I have this solution pretty easily shareable, I have UI with four steps:

1) Airtable OAuth  
2) Pick base  
3) Add webhook URL to your Airtable automation  
4) Pass incoming events to your schema changes table  
5) Activate / disable the service

1m37n1s,New to Airtable. Thoughts on use for a tutoring center?,"Hi all,

I've recently come across Airtable, and I'm contemplating on whether to use it for a tutoring center I run. I'll include some context about our business below. Overall, my question is: is it worth investing into Airtable and looking deeper into it for a tutoring center? Are there any other alternatives that may fit better?

**More info:**

* We have 8 tutors who teach private lessons and small-group lessons (up to 8 students max) to young children.
* We currently log all our information through Excel under one master file. This info includes data such as past and upcoming lessons, student attendance, the amount paid to each tutor for each lesson, and client payment history.
* Teaching materials are sent every day to tutors by our academic advisor. There are teaching materials for each lesson. Each lesson's teaching materials range from 1-10 worksheets or documents.
* Tutors constantly need to touch base with our program coordinator to know when their next lesson is scheduled. I'd like to have a feature where tutors could privately see their own lesson schedules for each day. Having tutors receive a mobile notification or SMS when a new student is booked would also be a plus.
* Parents purchase a 5-lesson package for their child. Before the 5th class occurs, I'd like a reminder to be sent to our email address notifying our program coordinators to call the parent and request payment.
* Students complete practice exams with us and scores are reported to the parent. I'd like to have develop a progress-tracking platform that parents can access to view their child's score whenever they wish.

1m2dqnb,Quarterly KPI Entry,"Hi team! I'm relatively new to Airtable, still evaluating it as a solution for some of our clients/contracts that need to (desperately) upgrade from Sheets and Excel. I'm familiar with relational databases, probably advanced novice/intermediate at actually setting up the schemas.

I have a use-case where we're helping an on-site manager keep track of their KPIs, which need to be reported quarterly. There are like 20 KPIs, mainly operations related, stuff like ""Average quarterly response time to customer requests <= 10 minutes"", ""Freelance roster growth of >= 5% each quarter"". Etc.

I'm trying to make it as easy as possible for the manager to get this setup each quarter and am expecting almost no ability to connect Airtable to the raw data sources due to data security protocols our client has with vendors. So, the thought was:

**KPI Definition** table with name, target, comparison type, notes, etc. Active/inactive.  
**KPI Summary Data** table that would track the results from each quarter. 2025 Q2 Average Response to Customer Request = 9.2. Date field, calculated quarter and year fields, lookup to the KPI Def table to get pass/fail calculated result. Supporting documentation attachment. *One record for each result?*

Where I'm particularly stuck here is in making this as easy as possible for the manager to get setup. If one record is one individual KPI result, he's going to have to create 20 new records each quarter? I'm brand new to Airtable's flavor of automation, but if I have a button in an interface ""Start New Quarter"", can I pre-populate those 20 new records and have him just update from there? Would adding a ""Reporting Periods"" table or something be helpful?

Thank you in advance!",2,1.0,4,2025-07-17 17:29:28+00:00,Thiseffingguy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Airtable/comments/1m2dqnb/quarterly_kpi_entry/,https://reddit.com/r/Airtable/comments/1m2dqnb/quarterly_kpi_entry/,Discussion,True,2025-08-26 03:28:13.146407+00:00,help_support,0.4,3,3,"Users are evaluating Airtable as a solution to replace legacy spreadsheet systems for clients needing to upgrade.; The core challenge is making KPI tracking and quarterly reporting easy for non-technical users, especially with data input limitations.; A structured approach to defining KPIs and then summarizing quarterly data is required.","This post shows Airtable being positioned as an upgrade from spreadsheets for business clients.

I haven't been able to dedicate much time to the sub lately, and because of my role, I'm not using Airtable to the depths that some of you are. I‚Äôd love to find some passionate people who are interested in growing the community and helping tackle questions.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for:

* Someone with experience using Airtable Enterprise.
* Someone who handles clients and has a good understanding of practical use cases.

If you work at Airtable, that's cool, but I believe the mods should be community members who can bring an independent perspective rather than just promoting the latest product updates.

I‚Äôd also love for the mods to spotlight Airtable service providers. This is a growing space, and highlighting expert voices who have skin in the game but aren‚Äôt tied to corporate interests could be a real win-win for the community.

I'll be here to support as best I can, but ultimately, I want this to be your project. We'll need to submit an Admin Request to take over the top mod role, as it's currently held by an inactive account (basically a squatter).
