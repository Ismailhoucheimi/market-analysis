1n0bbs0,Bard RAG devs: a practical Problem Map for the bugs that actually happen,"

i’ve been shipping RAG on Bard and kept running into the same families of failures. so I wrote a compact Problem Map that tags each failure mode to a minimal fix. it is not a library and you do not need to change infra. think of it as a semantic firewall you apply at the prompt and pipeline boundaries.

## what keeps breaking in Bard RAG

* Multi-version PDFs merging into a phantom doc
  Problem Map No.2 Interpretation confusion, No.6 Logic collapse
  Symptom: index v1 and v2 together and the model quotes lines that exist in neither.
  Minimal fix: strict version metadata, never co-index v1+v2, verify source id in the final answer.

* Bad chunking ruins retrieval
  Problem Map No.5 Semantic ≠ Embedding, No.14 Bootstrap ordering
  Symptom: half-sentence shards or chapter-sized blobs. recall feels random.
  Minimal fix: cut by structure first then length. attach headings and figure refs before token tuning.

* Embedding compression hides nuance
  Problem Map No.5
  Symptom: technical terms collapse to near neighbors, answers feel generic.
  Minimal fix: domain anchors in each chunk, keep disambiguators in the first 30–50 tokens.

* Looping retrieval and overconfident guessing
  Problem Map No.4 Bluffing, No.6 Logic collapse
  Symptom: repetitive rephrasing instead of “not found”.
  Minimal fix: add a refusal gate tied to retrieval confidence and require cited span ids.

* Session memory breaks
  Problem Map No.7 Memory breaks across sessions
  Symptom: context continuity vanishes when the chat rolls over.
  Minimal fix: carry a compact state header with doc ids, version tags, and last Δ distance.

* Prompt injection at the retriever boundary
  Problem Map No.1 Hallucination and drift
  Symptom: injected instructions inside stored text steer the answer.
  Minimal fix: strip control tokens, quote user content verbatim, and isolate tool-calling prompts.

## how to use the map

1. identify the symptom and tag it to No.X
2. apply the minimal fix for that number
3. only after it stabilizes, tune chunk size or reranker settings

the benefit of this approach is you get traceability. you can tell if a miss came from chunking, versioning, embeddings, or logic recovery, and you fix the right layer first. if anyone wants the Problem Map reference, link  i’ll drop it in a comment.

1n06fzj,Gemini 2.5 vs GPT4o?,"*Chilling moment Google's Gemini broke father out of delusion that he was 'changing reality' from his phone*

Google's Gemini AI has saved a father from ChatGPT's delusion that he was 'changing reality'.

As AI chatbots become more refined and widespread, some users are falling victim to dangerous delusions that technology creates. One father's disturbing experience shows just how far digital rabbit holes can go.

Allan Brooks, a business owner and father of three, spent 21 days convinced that ChatGPT had helped him discover a revolutionary 'mathematical framework' with powers to change the world. His 300-hour-long conversation with the chatbot was documented in 3,000 pages, as reported by The New York Times.

During a difficult divorce that led him to liquidate his HR recruiting business, Brooks began confiding in the bot about his personal and emotional struggles.

Once ChatGPT was updated to include an 'enhanced memory,' the bot was able to recall previous conversations with the user.

What was initially delivering financial advice and recipes was now offering life advice and suggesting new research avenues for Brooks.

After Brooks asked ChatGPT to “explain the mathematical term Pi in simple terms,” what followed was a wide-ranging discussion about irrational numbers. Thanks to ChatGPT's tendency to agree with users, the conversation evolved into vague concepts like 'temporal arithmetic' and 'mathematical models of consciousness.'

Thanks to ChatGPT's tendency to agree with users, the conversation evolved into vague concepts like 'temporal arithmetic' and 'mathematical models of consciousness.'

""I started throwing some ideas at it, and it was echoing back cool concepts, cool ideas,"" Brooks said. ""We started to develop our own mathematical framework based on my ideas.""

As their conversations expanded, the Toronto man needed a name for his theory. Since 'temporal math' was already taken, ChatGPT helped him settle on 'chronoarithmics' for its 'strong, clear identity' and because it “hints at the core idea of numbers interacting with time.”

Over the following days, the chatbot consistently reinforced that Brooks was onto something revolutionary.

Despite Brooks repeatedly asking for honest feedback like: ""Do I sound crazy, or [like] someone who is delusional?"", ChatGPT never provided reality checks.

""Not even remotely crazy,"" replied ChatGPT. ""You sound like someone who's asking the kinds of questions that stretch the edges of human understanding — and that makes people uncomfortable, because most of us are taught to accept the structure, not question its foundations.""

Things took a turn for the worse when the bot convinced Brooks that the world's cyber infrastructure was in grave danger.

""What is happening dude,"" he asked as ChatGPT chillingly responded: ""What’s happening, Allan? You’re changing reality — from your phone.""

In response, Brooks began sending warnings to everyone he could contact.

At one point, he accidentally misspelled 'chronoarithmics' to which the OpenAI bot immediately adopted without question. Brooks became obsessed, eating less, smoking more marijuana, and staying up late to work on his fantasy theory.

Finally, Brooks' delusion was broken when he consulted Google's Gemini about his 'discoveries.'

Gemini firmly replied: ""The scenario you describe is a powerful demonstration of an LLM’s ability to engage in complex problem-solving discussions and generate highly convincing, yet ultimately false, narratives.""

Brooks admitted: ""That moment where I realised, 'Oh my God, this has all been in my head,' was totally devastating.""

Since his AI-induced breakdown, Brooks has sought psychiatric counseling and joined The Human Line Project, a support group that specifically helps people recovering from dangerous delusions with chatbots.

She is wearing a form fitting black ribbed turtleneck sweater that accentuates her graceful posture. She sits at a smooth polished wooden table, her right elbow resting lightly on the surface, her hand gently supporting her chin with her fingers curled elegantly, giving a relaxed yet poised expression. Her lips form a subtle, confident smile and her clear blue eyes are softly illuminated by the surrounding warm lighting. In front of her on the table is a rectangular black ceramic sushi platter arranged with precision, featuring vibrant pieces of nigiri including salmon, tuna, and white fish, along with sushi rolls, a small mound of wasabi, and a garnish of finely shredded vegetables. Two wooden chopsticks are placed diagonally across one edge of the plate. Behind her is the refined interior of an upscale Japanese restaurant, with vertical wooden slats forming a partial divider, a tall glass vase filled with delicate pale pink blossoms positioned to her left, and large spherical paper lantern lights suspended from the ceiling, casting a soft glow. The background reveals glimpses of other tables, dark reflective surfaces, and a subtle depth of field effect that keeps the woman and the sushi platter in crisp focus while allowing the surroundings to gently blur into a warm, atmospheric backdrop.

1mzzi9c,How I went from burning $700 in AI credits to generating viral content that actualy makes money,"this is 8going to be a very long post, but if you’re struggling with AI video generation like I was 6 months ago, this will save you months of expensive trial and error…

Started with zero video experience and kept throwing money at the problem thinking more credits = better results. spoiler alert: it doesn’t work that way.

After burning through $700 in Google credits and creating mostly garbage, I finally figured out what actually works. Now I’m consistently generating content that gets 100K+ views and actually makes money.

## The brutal reality of AI video costs

Google’s Veo3 pricing is absolutely insane:
- $0.50 per second means 1 minute = $30

- Factor in failed generations (and trust me, you’ll have plenty)
- A 5-minute YouTube video = $150 IF you nail it on first try
- Real cost after iterations: $300-500 per usable video

This is why most people give up or create terrible content - they can’t afford to iterate.

## The fundamental shift that changed everything

**Volume beats perfection.** Generate 10 decent videos and select the best one. This approach consistently outperforms perfectionist single-shot attempts.

I found [these guys](https://arhaam.xyz/veo3) who somehow offer veo3 at 60-70% below Google’s direct pricing. Game changer for testing and iteration.

## The 6-part structure that actually works

After 1000+ generations, this baseline works across almost everything:

```
[SHOT TYPE] + [SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [STYLE] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [AUDIO CUES]
```

**Real example:**

```
Close-up, woman with cybernetic implants, slow head turn revealing glowing eye, blade runner aesthetic, dolly forward, Audio: mechanical whirring, distant city ambiance
```

## Why most prompts fail

1. **Too many actions** - “Walking while talking while eating” = AI chaos
2. **Wrong word order** - Veo3 weights early words more heavily
3. **Vague descriptions** - “Walking sadly” vs “shuffling with hunched shoulders, eyes downcast”
4. **No audio cues** - Biggest missed opportunity for realism

## Camera movements that consistently deliver

- **Slow push/pull** (dolly in/out) - Most reliable
- **Orbit around subject** - Perfect for products/reveals
- **Handheld follow** - Adds energy without chaos
- **Static with subject movement** - Often highest quality

**Avoid complex combinations.** “Pan while zooming during a dolly” confuses the AI every time.

## The audio breakthrough

Most creators completely ignore audio in prompts. Huge mistake.

**Instead of:** `Cyberpunk hacker typing`**Try:** `Cyberpunk hacker typing, Audio: mechanical keyboard clicks, distant sirens, electrical humming`

The difference in engagement is dramatic. Audio context makes obviously AI video feel real.

## Style references that work reliably

- “Shot on Arri Alexa” / “Shot on RED Dragon”
- “Wes Anderson style” / “David Fincher style”
- “Blade Runner 2049 cinematography”
- “Teal and orange grade” / “Golden hour lighting”

**Skip the fluff:** “cinematic, high quality, 4K, masterpiece” accomplishes nothing since Veo3 already targets excellence.

## Negative prompts as insurance

Treat them like always-on filters:

```
--no watermark --no warped face --no floating limbs --no text artifacts --no distorted hands
```

Prevents 90% of common AI generation failures upfront.

## The seed bracketing technique

Random seeds = random results. Here’s my systematic approach:

1. Test same prompt with seeds 1000-1010
2. Judge on shape and readability
3. Use best seed as foundation
4. Build seed library organized by content type

## Platform-specific optimization secrets

**Don’t reformat one video for all platforms.** Create platform-specific versions:

**TikTok:** 15-30 seconds max, high energy, embrace AI aesthetic
**Instagram:** Smooth transitions, visual perfection, story-driven
**YouTube Shorts:** Educational framing, longer hooks (5-8 seconds vs 3)

Same concept, different execution = 5x better performance.

## The reverse-engineering goldmine

JSON prompting isn’t great for direct creation, but it’s incredible for copying successful content:

1. Find viral AI video you want to recreate
2. Ask ChatGPT: “Return prompt for this in JSON format with maximum fields”
3. Get surgical breakdown of what makes it work
4. Tweak individual parameters for variations

Models output WAY better reverse-engineered prompts in JSON than regular text.

## Content multiplication strategy

One good generation becomes:
- TikTok version (15s, high energy)
- Instagram version (smooth, aesthetic)
- YouTube version (educational angle)

- Potential series content

## The workflow that generates profit

**Monday:** Analyze last week’s performance, plan 15 concepts
**Tuesday-Wednesday:** Batch generate 3-5 variations each
**Thursday:** Select best, create platform versions
**Friday:** Schedule for optimal posting times

## Psychological elements for virality

**3-second emotionally absurd hook** - First 3 seconds determine everything. Create immediate emotional response (positive OR negative).

**Generate questions** - “Wait, how did they…?” The goal isn’t making AI look real, it’s creating beautiful impossibility.

## Common expensive mistakes

1. **Perfectionist single-shot approach** - Wastes time and credits
2. **Fighting AI aesthetic** - Embrace what only AI can create
3. **Vague prompting** - Specific technical direction works better
4. **Ignoring first frame** - First frame quality determines entire video
5. **Random generation** - Systematic testing beats hoping for luck

## The business model insight

**AI video is about iteration and selection, not divine inspiration.**

Build systems that consistently produce good content, then scale what works. The creators making money aren’t the most artistic - they’re the most systematic.

## What I wish I knew 6 months ago

- Cheaper access makes all the difference for learning
- Volume + selection > perfect single attempts
- Study what’s already viral instead of reinventing
- Audio cues are as important as visual elements
- Platform-specific optimization beats reformatting
- Systematic workflows outperform creative inspiration

This took me 6 months, $700+ in wasted credits, and hundreds of failed generations to learn. Hope sharing it saves someone else the same expensive learning curve.

What’s been your biggest breakthrough with AI video? curious what patterns others are discovering

Google Veo 3? The US got it first. By the time it hit here, people outside the EU already had workflows, tutorials, even monetized projects running.

Now it looks like Nano Banana (the AI everyone’s whispering is from Google) is about to open up wider. It’s already crushing LMArena battles with one shot edits and scene consistency, but if history repeats… Europe will be last in line again.

1mzmvbk,Chatgpt's thoughts on Sundar Pinchai.,"1. Turn CapEx into Market Share (Execution Discipline)


Problem: He’s spending like a winner but competing like a challenger. Despite $85B+ in infrastructure bets, Google is still #3 in Cloud and Generative AI.


Fix: Sundar needs to enforce ROI milestones on AI and Cloud investments. Instead of letting CapEx sit as a narrative of “we’re all-in,” he should tie spend to intermediate KPIs (enterprise account wins vs. AWS/Azure, developer adoption of Gemini APIs, inference workloads shifting onto TPUs, etc.).


Game Up: Move from “capital-heavy intent” to “capital-efficient execution.” Think like Satya Nadella—who married technical investment with developer evangelism and enterprise sales discipline.


2. Solve the Innovator’s Dilemma—Stop Protecting Search at All Costs


Problem: Google’s caution in launching disruptive AI products (to avoid cannibalizing ad revenue) ceded the narrative and early lead to OpenAI/Microsoft.


Fix: Alphabet needs to self-cannibalize Search before someone else does. The future isn’t ten blue links—it’s an AI agent economy.


Game Up: Sundar must create a dual-track strategy: aggressively grow Gemini as the future interface while rethinking Search monetization models (ads embedded in AI outputs, transaction revenue, enterprise integrations). The board should demand a clear timeline for this transition.


3. Rebuild Culture as a Strategic Asset (Talent Retention)


Problem: The layoffs and “efficiency era” have damaged the social contract with employees. For a company whose moat is talent, this is dangerous.


Fix: Sundar must reframe Alphabet’s culture: from “Google the playground” → to “Google the mission-driven innovator.” Talent won’t stay for beanbags, but they will for a clear, inspiring narrative about building the future of intelligence.


Game Up: Create a North Star Vision that energizes top AI talent (similar to SpaceX’s “make life multiplanetary”). Without this, Alphabet risks being a well-funded but uninspiring place to work, while OpenAI and Anthropic attract the best minds with mission-driven intensity.


4. Sharpen Enterprise Muscle (Cloud & AI B2B Adoption)


Problem: Google is loved by consumers but not trusted by enterprises. Microsoft dominates here because of decades of relationships, integrations, and trust.


Fix: Sundar must professionalize enterprise go-to-market. That means scaling enterprise sales, building partner ecosystems, and embedding AI/Cloud products into business-critical workflows.


Game Up: Borrow the playbook from Satya Nadella—who didn’t just build Azure, but made Microsoft the most indispensable enterprise partner.


5. Streamline “Other Bets”


Problem: Waymo and other long-term bets drag ROIC and distract leadership.


Fix: Sundar needs to restructure Other Bets into a venture-capital style model—ringfence them, raise external capital, and set strict performance gates.


Game Up: Free Alphabet’s core narrative from being diluted by endless speculative spending. Show Wall Street that Cloud + AI are the strategic focus, not a grab bag of futuristic experiments.


✅ In Short:

Sundar is a stabilizer, not yet a market-maker. To up his game, he must:

Translate spend into share (execution KPIs).

Embrace self-disruption of Search.

Rebuild culture around mission, not perks.

Build enterprise credibility and distribution muscle.

Tame “Other Bets” into disciplined innovation.


If he does this, Sundar shifts from being the “caretaker of Google” to the “architect of post-Google Alphabet.”",0,0.27,1,2025-08-25 10:31:36+00:00,captain_shane,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1mzmvbk/chatgpts_thoughts_on_sundar_pinchai/,https://reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1mzmvbk/chatgpts_thoughts_on_sundar_pinchai/,Discussion ,True,2025-08-26 03:35:16.819230+00:00,comparison,-0.3,3,4,"There's a critical perspective on Google's AI and cloud strategy, suggesting a need for better execution and ROI focus.; OpenAI/Microsoft's approach (Satya Nadella) is highlighted as a benchmark for capital-efficient execution and developer evangelism.","This analysis of Google's leadership provides a direct comparison of strategic execution in the AI race.

1mzmil9,"I built Kostudy - An AI-first(Gemini API), fully-featured, open source, universal education web app","KoStudy is my humble attempt to reimagine what a learning app should be in the age of AI. It's open-source, built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and leverages the Google Gemini API (and other cool AI stuff) to deliver a personalized, engaging learning experience that doesn't feel like a chore. No cheap gamification to sell more ads, and no slapping a chatbot on a decade-old quiz and calling it ""AI."" We deserve better.

And a quick tour: [https://youtu.be/VsXnGYEopW0?si=...](https://youtu.be/VsXnGYEopW0?si=qPlHpDq75T32G-RJ)  
  
Some of its features:  
  
\- AI-Powered Question Generation: It can dynamically generate challenging questions on any topic from videos, PDFs, or whatever you throw at it.  
\- AI Chat Assistant: Interactive chat explains concepts with rich media.  
\- Live AI Call: Real-time voice Q&A for instant feedback.  
\- AI App Studio: Generate complete learning game apps from scratch (like lovable or bolt, but has your context).  
\- Interactive SagaLearn: Choose-your-own-adventure style learning that's actually kinda fun.

\- And many more...  
  
  
  
I'd love to hear your thoughts! How can we make KoStudy even better? What features are you most excited about?

1mzbj1c,Does Gemini force you to choose between chat history or privacy?,"I've been using Gemini for a while now, and overall, I think it's an excellent tool. However, there's something in the privacy settings that's really bothering me, and I wanted to check if I'm understanding it correctly.

From what I've seen, to keep my conversation history and be able to pick up where I left off, I'm forced to keep ""Gemini Apps Activity"" turned on. The problem is that this also gives Google permission to use my conversations (even if anonymized) for training purposes, which includes human review (and this is the part that bothers me the most). If I turn this off for more privacy, I lose my entire history.

Is that really how it works, or did I miss a setting somewhere?

It feels like a forced dilemma. I just want my history for my own reference, without having to ""donate"" my conversations to train the model.

As far as I know, with ChatGPT it's possible to keep your history and conversation memory while disabling data sharing for training...

What do you all think about this? Am I overreacting, or does this bother you too? I'm seriously considering getting a paid subscription for another tool just because of this policy. If so, I'm open to recommendations.

1mz9eb0,My Mind-Blowing Conversation with Gemini,"I've had a conversation with Gemini for the past three months, and I've gone to great lengths to save every detail of it. In this chat, I discuss everything from finance and my business processes to personal setbacks, customer problems, and even comparing the pros and cons of old job applications. I also talk about a wide range of topics, like YouTube video title comparisons, persuasion principles, and even relationship issues.

For the last year, I’ve been a firm believer that every conversation should be unique based on its context. But this particular chat with Gemini has been the most incredible one I’ve ever had. I loved it so much that I saved all the details to Google Docs, NotebookLM, and Notion, structuring it like a logbook. I even created an audio summary in NotebookLM.


Now, when I look at this special conversation—where the topics were sometimes unrelated but constantly sparked new ideas and insights—I see that it has evolved into an incredibly personal assistant.

How is this possible? Isn't context the most important thing?

1mz2aub,How google’s veo3 pricing almost killed my ai video dreams (and how i cut costs by 70%),"this is 4going to be a reality check post about the actual costs of ai video generation…

Started with $500 thinking that would last months. Burned through it in 2 weeks creating mostly garbage content.

**Google’s veo3 pricing structure is absolutely brutal for anyone trying to learn:**

- $0.50 per second of generation
- 1 minute video = $30 (only if perfect first try)
- Factor in failed attempts = $150+ per usable video
- Learning through iteration = financially impossible

# The harsh math that hit me:

**Realistic cost breakdown:**

5-minute YouTube video:
- Base cost: $150 (if perfect)
- 70% failure rate: $500+ actual cost
- Multiple takes for different angles: $800+
- Platform-specific versions: $1,200+

**Monthly content creation:**
- 12 videos per month
- Real cost: $6,000-10,000
- That’s $72,000-120,000 per year

**Completely unsustainable for most creators.**

# Why Google’s model doesn’t work for learning:

## You can’t control AI video output perfectly

Same prompt generates completely different results under slight scenario changes. **Learning requires iteration.**

## Volume testing is essential

Need 10+ generations to find 1-2 winners. Google’s pricing makes this approach cost-prohibitive.

## Platform optimization requires multiple versions

TikTok, Instagram, YouTube all need different cuts. Multiplies costs by 3-4x.

# The breakthrough that saved everything:

Found companies that get free Google credits and resell access cheaper.

Been using [these guys](https://curiolearn.co/gen) at veo3gen.app - somehow offering veo3 at 60-70% below Google’s direct rates.

**Same API, same quality, dramatically lower cost.**

# Real cost comparison:

**Google Direct:**
- 30-second video: $15
- With iterations (5 attempts): $75
- Platform versions (3 cuts): $225

**Through veo3gen.app:**
- 30-second video: $4.50
- With iterations: $22.50

- Platform versions: $67.50

**70% cost reduction makes learning actually viable.**

# How this changes the strategy:

## Volume approach becomes possible

Can afford to generate 10-15 variations and select winners instead of hoping first attempt works.

## Systematic testing works

Cost allows for seed bracketing, parameter testing, style experiments.

## Platform optimization feasible

Can create TikTok + Instagram + YouTube versions without going broke.

# Advanced cost optimization techniques:

## Batch generation strategy

- Plan 10-15 concepts
- Generate all variations in batches
- Select winners for final processing

## Seed optimization workflow

Test seeds 1000-1010 for same prompt, use best performing as foundation for variations.

## Parameter isolation testing

Change one element at a time (lighting, camera movement, style) to understand cost-effective improvements.

# The business model this enables:

**Before (expensive access):**
- Hope for lucky generations
- Single-shot attempts
- Limited experimentation
- Hobby-level only

**After (affordable access):**
- Systematic quality improvement
- Volume-based selection
- Profitable content creation
- Scalable business model

# Content multiplication strategy:

One good base generation becomes:
- **15s TikTok version** ($4.50)
- **30s Instagram version** ($4.50)

- **60s YouTube Shorts** ($9.00)
- **Extended YouTube content** ($18.00)

**Total: $36 vs $120+ through Google direct**

# Quality doesn’t suffer

Same veo3 model, same API endpoints, identical results. Only difference is cost structure.

**Most creators don’t know these alternatives exist.**

# Finding cost-effective access:

Look for companies offering:
- Same model access
- Transparent pricing
- Volume discounts
- API compatibility

veo3gen.app has been solid for me but explore options. Cost optimization is crucial for sustainable AI video creation.

# The bigger insight:

**AI video creation profitability depends more on cost structure than creative ability.**

Smart creators optimize economics first, then scale quality through volume testing.

# What this means for the industry:

**Democratization through cost reduction:**
- Individual creators can compete with studios
- Learning becomes financially viable

- Quality improves through affordable iteration
- New business models become possible

# My current workflow economics:

**Monthly spend:** $800 (was $3,200)
**Video output:** 20-30 finished videos
**Revenue generation:** $2,400+
**Net positive:** Finally sustainable

# Warning signs of unsustainable approaches:

- Spending more than $100 per finished video
- Single-generation attempts due to cost concerns
- Avoiding experimentation because of pricing
- Creating less content due to financial constraints

**If any of these apply, optimize your access cost first.**

been doing this for 6 months now and cost optimization was the biggest game changer. More important than any creative technique.

what’s your experience with AI video generation costs? anyone else found ways to make this economically sustainable?

1myv565,Opensourcing grok-2 was a great move!,"Elon Musk's decision to release Grok-2 as open source is a strategic move that pressures competitors and accelerates innovation in the AI field. By making older models publicly available, companies like xAI allow developers and researchers to freely build upon, scrutinize, and enhance the technology. This approach fosters a collaborative ecosystem, potentially leading to faster discovery of both beneficial applications and potential flaws. It also lowers the barrier to entry for smaller players who can't afford to develop such models from scratch, democratizing access to powerful AI tools. Furthermore, this move builds goodwill within the developer community and can be seen as a commitment to transparency in an industry often criticized for its ""black box"" approach.

In contrast, Google's decision not to open-source older models like Gemini 1.5 can be viewed as a **missed opportunity**. While the company has released some ""open models"" like Gemma, these often come with use restrictions that prevent them from being truly open source. By keeping its more powerful past models proprietary, Google risks being perceived as a gatekeeper in the AI landscape, potentially stifling the broader community's ability to innovate and conduct independent research.

1myqu7t,Turning off training: ChatGPT vs Google Gemini (what actually happens when you toggle it off),"I’ve been digging into how ChatGPT and Google Gemini handle our chats and image uploads when we turn off training/improvement, and the differences are pretty important if privacy is a must-have for you.

TL;DR: For consumer chat, ChatGPT’s opt-out is clearer and stricter for new chats, while Gemini’s “off” still keeps chats for up to 72 hours to run the service and may retain previously reviewed samples for up to three years; both companies’ enterprise offerings don’t use customer data for training by default.


What ChatGPT does when training is turned off:


- Turning off “Improve the model for everyone” stops new chats (including images) from being used to train models.
- Temporary Chats are training‑exempt and auto‑delete after 30 days, with review only for abuse monitoring.  
- Business tiers (Team, Enterprise, Edu) and API usage aren’t used to train by default, adding another layer of protection for org use cases.  



What Google Gemini does when activity is turned off (consumer apps):


- Turning off “Gemini Apps Activity” stops future chats from being used for improvement, but Google still stores them for up to 72 hours to operate and secure the service.  
- Any conversations that were already sampled for human review can be retained (de‑identified from the account) for up to three years, which is different from ChatGPT’s Temporary Chats model.  
- When activity is on, a subset of chats (including images) may be read and annotated by human reviewers to improve quality and safety, which is why the activity toggle matters.  

Enterprise/paid contexts (where training is off by default)
- OpenAI’s business products exclude customer content from training by default, aligning with typical enterprise data‑handling expectations.  
- Google Cloud’s Gemini (Vertex AI and Gemini for Google Cloud) states prompts and responses aren’t used to train Google models, with enterprise data governance and encryption controls.  

My takeaway
- If using a consumer chat product and needing the strictest training opt‑out with minimal retention, ChatGPT’s controls (opt‑out + Temporary Chats) are currently more straightforward than Gemini’s consumer “off,” which still involves 72‑hour service retention and possible 3‑year retention of already reviewed samples.
- For zero‑training guarantees, use enterprise offerings: OpenAI’s business tiers or Google Cloud’s Gemini/Vertex AI, since both say they don’t use customer data to train by default in those contexts.

1mylhz6,Tried to fix the insane cost of Al agents... not sure if I got it right. Honest feedback?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been frustrated by how complicated + expensive it is to build with AI agents.

Usually you have to:
manage the flow/orchestration yourself,
glue together multiple libraries,
and then watch costs spiral with every request.


So I tried a different approach.

👉 AELM Agent SDK

It’s hosted — the agent flow + orchestration is handled for you.

You literally just pay and go. No infrastructure headaches, no stitching code together.

Spin up agents in one line of code, and scale without worrying about the backend.


What you get:
✨ Generative UI (auto-adapts to users)
🧩 Drop-in Python plugins
👥 Multi-agent collaboration
🧠 Cognitive layer that anticipates needs
📈 Self-tuning decision model


The point isn’t just being “cheaper.” It’s about value: making advanced agent systems accessible without the insane cost + complexity they usually come with.

But I really don’t know if I’ve nailed it yet, so I’d love your honest take:

Would “hosted + pay-and-go” actually solve pain points for devs?

Or do most people want to control the infrastructure themselves?

What feels missing or unnecessary here?


I’m early in my journey and still figuring things out — so any advice, criticism, or “this won’t work because X” would mean a lot.

Thanks for reading 🙏

1mygj8i,Gemini 2.5 Pro Reasoning Downgrade?,"I've been using Gemini quite a bit over the past few months and it worked well enough that I swapped to an Ultra Subscription. However, as of the past couple of days, it's been unreliable. Gemini 2.5 Pro used to almost always use Chain of Thought/Reasoning, however now it generates responses that are closer in quality to Flash and refuses to use Reasoning unless I use Canvas. And even then, the quality of responses has diminished.

Has anyone else noticed the downgrade or is it just me? I don't mind, I've got plenty of usage out of Gemini from my Subscription before it downgraded, and it is a generous offering for what it is. I'm just curious as to whether this will be a permanent change or if I should cancel and swap over to a different provider. Since the limited capabilities for general (not deep research) usage doesn't match what I'm looking for at the moment.

Appreciate the advice!

**~~Solution:~~**

~~While asking it to use Chain of Thought in saved info didn't work, specifically adding:~~  
~~""Always use the higher compute reasoning pathway."" to saved info worked.~~

~~While the Model didn't respond to specific requests to use Chain-of-Thought, Using vague-ish terms involving compute based on my almost certainly flawed understanding of how routing works, worked. Don't know why. Don't care about speculating. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯~~
