1mzwg25,Jira Customer Management,"Hey,

We have an issue with how our customers are created.
We want them to have portal only accounts.

I activated „allow externals to create portal only accounts“ and also activated that users can sent request without logging in.

We now want them to only be added to the customer tab, but for some reason they are also added to the project directory(people and access) and are assigned the „service desk customer“ role, which we don’t want. 

I went through the permission scheme and settings to see why this is the case, but couldn’t figure it out.

Is there any good solution to have it set up so that:
Users can sent in tickets via the portal without the need to create an account and afterwards are only added to the customer tab ? Or do we need to provision them manually so that we don’t have the risk of having randoms in our project directory.

Not sure if any of that makes sense, but I am writing this on my way home and hope that someone has an idea or was confronted with this before.

Thanks :)

1mzv23u,Can I add a burndown chart to a team-managed kanban board?,"I've done a lot of googling, and THINK the answer is no, but I want to check:

I want to add time estimates to a Kanban board, because burndown charts make me happy. I tried adding the ""original estimate"" field to my tasks, but that didn't seem to do anything and I can't find any sort of burndown chart that uses those.

I read that you can only use ""real"" time estimates and burndown charts for scrum boards, and that I can create a new scrum board and link my kanban board to it. And when I create a scrum board, there's a drop-down to choose a kanban board to associate it with, but that dropdown is empty. I guess I need to be on company jira rather than team jira to do that?

1mx4uzf,Sync Jira tasks to Google Calendar for CEO 1:1 agendas with check-off ability,"Hi all,

Looking for a practical way to mirror issues from a private Jira project into Google Calendar so our CEO can use his calendar as the agenda for 1:1s with department leads.

**What we need**

* Source: one private Jira Software project with issues that represent talking points per lead
* Output: populate each relevant 1:1 calendar event with the matching Jira issues in the event description
* During the meeting: be able to mark items as discussed in the event description (simple checkboxes or similar), then reflect that state back in Jira if possible
* Ongoing: add new items from Jira and have them appear automatically in upcoming events
* Security: respect Jira permissions and keep everything private to the CEO
* Preference: low maintenance. A marketplace app or no-code option is great. A small custom script is fine if it is reliable

**Environment**

* Jira Software Cloud, company-managed project
* Google Workspace and Google Calendar

**What I am considering**

* Jira Automation that pushes a formatted agenda into calendar events
* Zapier or Make to keep Jira issues and event descriptions in sync
* Atlassian Marketplace options like Calendar for Jira or similar
* Google Apps Script that pulls a JQL query and writes agendas into recurring events

**Questions**

* Has anyone built a clean checklist-in-event workflow that writes meeting outcomes back to Jira?
* Any marketplace apps, templates, or sample scripts you would recommend?
* Pitfalls to avoid like rate limits, event overwrite conflicts, or permission gotchas?

For the past few months, several random users each week have had an issue with field content in one ticket being unexpectedly copied over to another ticket. Basically this is the process they all have generally gone through:

1. Open ticket #1, made some edits to say field 1, 2, and 3. Saved, then approved and transitioned the ticket to the next approver.
2. Open ticket #2 (same project), made some edits to field 2. Saved.

As they hit save on ticket #2, the field content (field 1, 2, 3) from ticket #1 automatically replaced the content in ticket #2 despite being unrelated and the user never touched the other two fields.

At first it was just one project, now it's like it's spreading and affecting several projects.

1mur509,OAuth 2 vs. PAT for API usage in Jira Data Center,"Hello everyone,

I have a question about authentication for API calls in Jira (Data Center 10.3.8).

A developer at my company has written a script that synchronizes assets from an external application to Jira (-Assets) on a daily basis. This is not an app from the Atlassian Marketplace, but rather our own internal solution.

The developer has submitted a service request asking me to provide him with a token that he can use to authenticate and authorize himself to perform API calls against Jira-Assets.

First, I provided him with a PAT for an automation user with the appropriate permissions. But now I'm wondering:

* Which is more suitable for this use case – OAuth 2 or a personal access token?
* In which scenarios should I use OAuth 2 in Jira, and in which cases are personal access tokens the better choice? 
* If a personal access token is used, would you limit its validity period for security reasons (if so, to what period and why this particular period)? There is currently no regulation/guideline regarding the duration of the validity of PATs in my company. Therefore, it would be interesting to know how other companies handle this.

1mpiarm,Best practices for slicing epics and boards,"Hi everyone,

For context, I‘m a BA (effectively more of a product owner) in a corporate organisation that isn‘t fully agile.

I have a JIRA project with currently two Epics and one board that I'm working on with my dev team.

Now my boss wants me (or us, i.e. him and me) to start tracking new upcoming projects in Epic form. Tracking probably means a lot of tasks for the explorative phase but eventually breaking the Epics down into user stories and managing the implementation.

I think it makes sense to create the new epics in the same JIRA project to avoid having things too scattered around. Plus, many of the initiatives will be rather small and don't warrant their own project in my opinion.

While I'm pretty set on the project question, I'm unsure about the boards. Usually thus far, I always had a board per team and it has worked pretty well. Now, however, the ""team"" definitions are a little bit blurry. There's me and the dev team, me and my boss, as well as other business SMEs that will be involved in some of the projects here and there. And if anyone is wondering: The involvement is too sporadic and the projects too small to bother to define a new ""team"" encompassing the relevant people.

 I think my tendency is to slice the boards by team and/or by epic.

By team if there's a dedicated dev team for the implementation

By epic if it's smaller-scale initiatives that involve a bunch of people from different teams or for anything in the exploratory phase.

Goal: Keep things easy to maintain and avoid cross-contamination of the boards/sprints.

Any thoughts on my proposed solution? Any best practices I'm missing?

Thanks in advance!

1mobhoq,"How painful is release management in Jira for you? Looking for honest feedback from engineers, PMs, and anyone involved in releases","Hey everyone,

I've been using Jira for release management for a while now, and both from my own experience and talking to colleagues across different roles, I keep hearing the same thing: Jira's release management features feel clunky and not really built with the actual release process in mind.

While this seems to affect everyone involved in releases, I've noticed it's particularly painful for product development engineers who need quick access to release information and smooth deployment workflows.

I'm curious if this is a universal pain point or just something in my bubble.

**Some common complaints I've heard:**

* Too many clicks to get basic release info
* Poor visibility into what's actually going into a release
* Manual processes that should be automated
* Disconnected from actual deployment pipelines
* Version management feels like an afterthought
* Hard to coordinate between engineering, QA, and product teams

I'm actually in the early stages of building a platform specifically designed to handle release management with a developer-first approach (but keeping all stakeholders in mind) - something that would integrate with Jira but handle all the release orchestration in a way that actually makes sense for product development teams.

**I'd love to hear about your experience:**

* How does your team currently handle release management in Jira?
* What are your biggest frustrations with the current setup?
* What workarounds have you had to implement?
* What would your ideal release management workflow look like?

Any pain points, horror stories, or wishlist items would be incredibly valuable as I'm trying to understand if this is a problem worth solving at scale.

1mn7zy4,Limited workflows in iOS apps?,"Hi everyone, I just started with Jira for a personal project and I set up the project in Jira and I also linked confluence pages to tasks. I now installed the iOS apps and it seems that the apps are missing a lot of features, for example:

- I don’t see any possibility to access/add/modify confluence pages in the Jira iOS app. 

- I don’t see any way to access my project view in a similar fashion as in the PC web view, i.e., I have reduced the tabs to my own needs (without Forms tab etc). 

- when I simply want to add a task in the iOS app, I don’t find any easy way to attach this task directly to an epic. Instead, I have to search for the epic, edit that, and create a new task for this epic.

1mjvbof,Add action item macro as default value to description field,"I'm currently trying to create a JSM request with an attached form. I'd like the description field to contain a list of action items (as default value), that I can use as a checklist for the agents.

1miypcw,How to organize sprint in Jira with multiple teams?,"I want to have agile sprints in Jira. Usually, a piece of work might involve multiple teams: Design, Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, QA, etc, and they can have dependencies on each other.

In a classic Jira scrum board, we have Story (which is a task level), and Task (which is actually a subtask level or hierarchy level -1).

The main problem is that the teams might work on the same piece of work in different sprints because of their dependencies. **We cannot use workflow as such**:

* Story: Implement screen A
   * Task: Design - design the screen A
   * Task: Frontend - implement the screen A
   * Task: QA - test the screen A

Because individual tasks cannot be tracked over the sprints, only stories can. We want to put Design in Sprint 1, and Frontend into Sprint 2. This would also involve all sorts of issues from planning work, to a wrong burndown chart because the Story would be 3 sprints in progress.

The other solution is to **move everything one level up**. In this case, we need to utilize epics to keep track of overall feature completeness.

* Epic: Implement screen A
   * Story: Design - design the screen A
   * Story: Frontend - implement the screen A
   * Story: QA - test the screen A

* Some rely solely on Assets
* Others use generalist apps like Elements Connect or External Data for Jira
* Some go all-in with ScriptRunner or other custom methods

This might be an incredibly stupid and simple question, but I am very new to Jira, and on our team, we don't use a lot of the features; we just use the very basic stuff. I don't know the right terminology for stuff, so hopefully I can explain myself.

You know, when you go and create a card, you can do custom fields such as adding a field for a description, a drop-down list, labels, due dates, and things like that.

\[Yes\] further drop-down list available \[football\] \[tennis\] \[badminton\]

\[No\] no drop-down list required

1mh6b2h,Rearrange the order of status in Jira into something that makes sense.,"This one took me a while to figure out, so I'm sharing here to see if it helps others.

I was trying to order a filter by status and noticed that the order was awkwardly random. In the end I looked at the admin status page and noticed that you can rearrange them in there.

Sounds obvious, but the trick is in this page there's no drag and drop. So you have to click on the up and down arrows and every click triggers a hard refresh, so you can't click again for 6 seconds.

I haven't been able to find any way to do this automatically via the API, at least not for Jira Cloud.

I later found out a hack: if you right click on the arrows very fast, the new tabs will open with the new position of the status!

I wish there was a better way to do this, but I think it's something that needs to be done for any project where you want to report on issues by status. I really hate that the list starts anywhere, you have Done on the third place and Backlog afterwards...

Even in the screenshot below the method failed and for some reason Done is still showing up in the middle of the list.

I'm a reasonably experienced Jira admin running into an issue with an automation I'm setting up. Starting conditions below:

Atlassian Platform - Cloud  
Jira Product - Jira Service Management  
Project Type - Team Managed

I've created an automation that edits the issue summary to something meaningful based on smart values from a couple of fields.

When I set myself as the rule actor, things work just fine. When I set Automation for Jira as the rule actor, the rule fails to modify the summary and the log shows the following message:

`Edited work item successfully, however some of the set fields aren't available. Fields ignored:Summary (summary)`

I don't have a really strong understanding of how the Automation for Jira user is permissioned in team-managed projects, but my expectation was that it would at least have enough juice to edit fields on issues.

Can anyone offer any experience or areas to explore?

1mdieq6,How To Use Rules / Automations To Distribute Release Notes?,"Hello, need some help with Jira Automations to ***distribute*** release notes....  
  
I want to use Jira's native automation builder to trigger the sending of release notes to designated slack channels.

Steps So Far:

1. We use the native 'generate release notes' function once a release is finalized. We do not use confluence. 
2. It creates the notes document and we use the ""save release notes"" button to save it to the release 
3. I can now  create my automation (see image)....

  
What I cannot figure out is the 'action'. ""Send email"" & ""send slack"" are available, but inserting the right information into the body of the message via ""Smart Values"" isn't working. None of the provided options include  the natively created release notes with all the work items.

1mbzeni,Why Integration Between Salesforce and Jira Can Be a Challenge (And Some Solutions),"Hi everyone! A few weeks ago, a system admin from an insurance company shared some pain points they were facing when trying to sync r/salesforce  with r/jira . 

Some hot pain points and use cases they pointed out include:

* Keeping customer cases and development work items in sync between Salesforce and Jira.
* Allowing the customer experience team to close Salesforce cases directly from Jira.
* Automatically populating Salesforce fields with Jira ticket status when new insights are added.
* Syncing multiple related Salesforce entities to Jira work items.

They had tried a few integration solutions, but none were flexible enough or came with a price tag that made sense for their needs.

After a bit of searching, they came across an integration tool that helped them resolve these issues. 

What worked for them? Features like AI-based sync script generation and a flexible, decentralized architecture. These allowed them to customize their integration and sync specific Salesforce fields with Jira work fields in a way that matched their processes.

Here’s a helpful video that demonstrates how integrations like these can be set up to sync any Salesforce entity with Jira and other tools. It might give you some ideas for solving similar challenges.

1m6j7e0,Help! Get 1 task to appear in 2 projects,"My team (Marketing) does not use Jira for our project management, we use Asana.

That works great when the task is created in the Marketing Jira board (MKTG)!

1m4d99y,Isolating External Clients,"Hi,

I'm setting up Jira and Confluence as a small consultancy with multiple external independent clients. I want them to be able to browse both Jira and Confluence, with certain permissions.

I'm using Atlassian Cloud.

I don't mind paying for the full user license cost for each client. However, no matter what I try, with my test users (simulating each client), they can see each other. I don't want that. I'm using permissions on each space/project to separate users, tweaked the ability to browse users. That protects content and issues, but nothing stops them clicking on ""Teams"" and getting a full list of users, namely my other clients. I don't want each client knowing the details of each other client.

Other tools I am using tend to have guest accounts or similar that can be used to isolate clients. Is this something that is actually possible with Jira/Confluence, or am I just wasting my time trying? As far as I can tell, the only way to fully isolate them is to run multiple instances, and deal with the corresponding cost, inconvenience, and chance that Atlassian might not like running multiple small instances with 2-3 users.

I've found tools that let you split off customizable views, perhaps I could use that, but I'm wondering if I can more precisely lock down Jira and Confluence to prevent clients finding one another instead. I'd rather my clients be able to browse.

Does anyone know if this is possible?

(also posting here as Jira issues are the more important of the two, and the Confluence one might be solvable otherwise)

Update: Thanks to the feedback so far, I've been having some success. I've been removing users from (product)-users-(site) and adding them to projects/spaces (via groups), which behaved far differently than I'd expected, and seems to considerably limit what they can do outside of the project/space, which is what I was looking for. The Teams link I mentioned no longer goes to an overview of all users, it just goes to a profile, which is superb. In addition, I've been experimenting with using Confluence Guest accounts, also to some success.

Update 2: I've had some success with the above (removing users from (product)-users-(site), Guest Accounts in Fonfluence), it's almost exactly what I want. One thing I've noticed is that I can't assign the client to Jira issues, their name doesn't come up. However, as it's basically the client and myself, it's not essential for the time being. This has bought me a bit of time to experiment, so I might be able to self-solve this one. Thankyou everyone for your help and suggestions, I'm going to refer back to the thread for directions to experiment along with, so everything has been helpful.

1m2q8e7,Best way to set up a Jira board for tracking high-level marketing launches?,"Hi! I’m looking for help setting up a Jira board specifically to track final promotional marketing tactics, but not every task that leads up to them, but just the launch dates so we can easily see when things are going live in a calendar view.

Right now, we use Jira for the Product Marketing team to track every request and task needed to launch a tactic. But for this use case, we need a higher-level marketing board that focuses on launch-level tracking for things like website content, blog posts, emails, newsletters, webinars, and social posts.

Here’s what I’m currently doing:
 - I’m entering launch dates as either “Tasks” or “Sub-tasks” and tagging them with a specific label, like Launch-Calendar.
- Then I created a project board that automatically filters for anything with that label.

Some observations and thoughts: 
- Kanban View: It’s not super helpful here since we don’t care about “To Do / In Progress / Done” for these. Ideally, we’d be able to filter or group by promo tactic (like Email, Social, Webinar, etc.), but I’m not sure how to set that up.
 - Calendar View: It mostly works for seeing launch dates, but it’s a bit hard to scan and organize.
 - List View: I was thinking of adding a custom field like “Content Type” so people could sort or filter the list view by tactic.

I’m wondering:
- Would it make sense to create new issue types based on the promotional tactic?
- Is there a better way to structure this within our existing Jira setup so the marketing team can easily reference and update launch timing without having to build something from scratch in another tool?

Open to ideas and would love to hear if others have solved something similar!

1m0kov5,Need help exporting attachments out of Jira Server,"Hi there,

I've been assigned to export all attachments from our company's Jira Server instance as part of a migration to a new platform. We've ran into some issues however because the native backup and export tools don't seem to allow exporting attachments alongside ticket data in a single step.

I'm not very familiar with Jira, so I'm looking for a straightforward solution, whether through built-in functionality or (ideally free) plugins, that would let us extract all attachments while preserving their associations to the related tickets.

TL/DR:  
How can i export all attachments from Jira Server while keeping their associations to the respective issues intact?",2,1.0,5,2025-07-15 15:24:02+00:00,Plainsighter,https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1m0kov5/need_help_exporting_attachments_out_of_jira_server/,https://reddit.com/r/jira/comments/1m0kov5/need_help_exporting_attachments_out_of_jira_server/,beginner,True,2025-08-26 03:34:49.198226+00:00,migration,0.1,3,3,"Users migrating from Jira Server face challenges with data export, specifically attachments.; Native tools or readily available plugins for bulk attachment export are insufficient.; Preserving the association between attachments and their respective issues is critical during migration.","This highlights a critical pain point for users migrating *away* from Jira Server, specifically concerning data integrity (attachments).

1m0jgqk,absolutely hate the new UI,"hi all, I’ve used jira for over a year at my current job and logged in today to see that the UI has completely changed. everything is closer together and looks super messy, but most importantly all the navigation at the top has moved into a sidebar… and all the things originally in a sidebar were moved to the top. basically everything has somehow moved. I had to watch a whole youtube video to figure out how to use it now. I just wanted to express my frustration with the new changes that were 1) completely unnecessary and 2) make things more confusing for current users. to the atlassian team: what was the point of this? other than to force users to stay in jira longer, reducing efficiency? maybe you should actually consider the people who are using your product and what THEY need when making major changes.

1exm23f,Notes for vendors using r/jira,"Hi there, your hangry neighbourhood mod team here

The vendors are out of control recently so I’m putting this together so we don’t have to simply ban all marketing activity on the sub.

Rules:

1. Be transparent, open and honest. The first 2 lines of your post should include intent and affiliation. One warning then ban.

2. Use the advertising / recruitment flair. No exceptions. One warning then ban.

3. Any form of thinly veiled marketing will simply be removed with no warning or explanation. I’m tired of explaining the same things over and over. 

Recommendations:

1. Stop writing long ramble stories. We’re system admins not product owners and will not read it.

2. If you want your posts to be taken seriously by technical SME’s consider this structure

Hi r/jira my name is (name) and I am (role) at (company)

- bullet point
