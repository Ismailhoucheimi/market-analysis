I’ve been using Obsidian for a couple years and recently started playing around with the Bases plugin. I’m from the humanities, so I don’t have much background in programming, syntax, or formulas, but I usually pick up tech stuff pretty fast.

Right now I’m trying to use Bases to track my reading. I love that I can do this inside Obsidian instead of relying on Goodreads or other apps. As you can see in the screenshot, I’d like to create a formula that:

* shows me the percentage of the book I’ve read
* counts how many days I’ve been reading it

Is that doable with Bases? If yes, does anyone know of any resources (guides, tutorials, examples) I can check out to learn how to build formulas like this? Even a basic “step by step” would help a lot.

1n05v4i,Dynamic Base for daily notes - today across time,"https://preview.redd.it/4ic12yoow8lf1.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=05df35b136d55a7f4e5412d42a53094e01fd4dea

Previously I had a dataview query in my daily note template that would list all past daily notes for the same month and day. This is great to see what was going on in previous years. As I was trying to recreate it with Bases, I was struggling to get it to work. I found a few options on the web but they all seemed quite complex. I think I came across a simpler version.

My daily notes follow the date format YYYY-MM-DD for the file name. The key is to extract only the month and day from all daily notes and have it match to the current daily note file name. That's it!

Here is the whole thing:

`date(file.name).month == date(this.file.name).month && date(file.name).day == date(this.file.name).day && date(file.name).year != date(this.file.name).year`

A few notes on how this works:

* in the parenthesis of the **date()** function you can put any property or filename that holds a date.
* follow up with **.month** or **.day**, or even **.year** to access the relevant section of the date
* the double ampersan **&&** is the boolean AND
* use double equal sign **==** to establish a match
* use **!=** to establish a different or negation NOT

It basically reads like this: *the month of any file name MATCH to the month of this file name AND the day of any file name MATCH to the day of this file name AND the year of any file name IS NOT the year of this file name.*

That last bit, with the NOT, is so the current daily note does not appear in the list.

And this is what it looks like when typed into the Bases filter section:

https://preview.redd.it/65wr70q6y8lf1.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=0808e34a0b85d6933407c1ed55b8e2135f223258

You'll notices that as a global filter I have that it only look for files in my ""*7 Calendario*"" folder, which is where I keep all of my daily notes (dating back to 2004). Then, for the current view (*this view*) I added the formula to match to the current file.

Since the entire Base is filtered to look only within 1 folder structure, I plan to have 1 view for the daily notes template, which is the one you see in the screen grab. When inserted into the daily note it dynamically shows all past daily notes based on the current note (see [this.file.name](http://this.file.name) function). In other views I can create other lists around daily notes. This way I have one Base for all things daily notes 😎.

Putting this together was a bit of me going through the Obsidian help page, a Youtube video and a bit of AI work with ChatGPT:

* [Bases syntax - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/syntax)
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-vDOgrwpnE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-vDOgrwpnE)
* With ChatGPT I had to activate the web search for it to work because it kept referring to dataview.

the thing is, I thought that I could benefit from also having weekly notes with the goal to have a wider perspective into my life and notes. but I don’t really utilize my weekly notes that much, because I don’t use them to journal or keep track of habits. the one thing I do is dump multiple tasks that don’t have a hard set date into the weekly note so I can get to them later, I also keep a little highlights section to the memorable moments from that week and a little stats section with a dataview query for all created and updated notes that week.

* A Base to list all my ""Watch Later"" notes

But here's the thing: I have a property called ""watched"". It's a boolean, so I can tick whenever I watch a video. My Base filter for notes with this property set to ""false"". So it's all good because I won't see all of the already watched videos.

1mzyljw,Better search and Querying with command line tools: fd and rg (inside the terminal),"I noticed that as my vault grew, searching and finding notes within it became incredibly difficult. I understand that everyone will suggest Obsidian's core search, perhaps the Omnisearch plugin, or even propose creating a system to tag notes and so on. Let's be honest, the overhead of constantly needing to maintain and organize notes is tough. I do use links, tags, and properties, but always thinking about the need to future-proof your notes is annoying. Sometimes I just want to quickly jot something down and be able to find it easily.

Over the past couple of months, I've started experimenting more and more with command-line tools in the terminal. While I wouldn't say it made me more productive, I just felt more ""hacky"" and ""cool""

The two most used commands are rg and fd. Don't get me wrong, Obsidian's core features are great, but Obsidian's search features sucks and is so slow. Since everything is a Markdown file and a folder, all you have to do is simply enter your vault's directory inside a terminal shell and execute these commands:

rg : [https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

It works just like grep. rg helps you search text inside files. Its super fast. There are many helper parameters you can use, but honestly the easiest thing to do is this:  
\`\`\`rg ""pattern""\`\`\`  where pattern is the query your looking for. it will literally search your whole vault if you are in root directory of your vault.

Here's an example: i used \`\`\`rg python \`\`\`

fd: [https://github.com/sharkdp/fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)  
It works just like find command, and all it does is locate entries in your filesystem. Just like rg, it's super fast and has many helper functions. If you ever just want to try it out, running

fd ""pattern"" within your vault directory will search for files with that name. It's super useful! For example:  
fd python

I have been experimenting with appending  these operation within a md file.

Example:  
\`\`\`fd  Sebastien >> found\_text\_files.md\`\`\`

this append a list of Sebastien files to 'found\_text\_files.md.

In summary, this is just a glorified dataview but in the terminal. i know many dont feel comfortable with the terminal so this is definitely a con. Maybe someone can one day make a  plugin that can wrap these command within obsidian :)

Hope that those who have never tried these command line tools before can give a try :) These tools are not native to your computer, so  follow the installation links provided  in the github repos.

There are many other CLI tools you can use.  This is a pretty cool vid that gives a summary. :

For those who've been waiting patiently, thank you! I know it's been months, but I've been busy at work and haven't had much time to spare.

The good news is, I've integrated the **Style Settings plugin** into the theme, which means you'll have a ton of new ways to personalize it. Whether you like different colors, monochrome colors, or just plain gray scale, now you can. With Style Settings plugin, you can now:

* Pick from different theme variants: groovy, simple, or minimalism.
* Change the border radius from super-sharp to extra-large.
* Modify accent's hue rotation (create your own color scheme)
* Adjust accent colors for both dark and light modes.
* Mess with the typography and folder icon chroma/saturation.
* Hide or show heading and footer dividers.
* Tweak image settings like alignment and borders.

1mzxgde,Need help configuring on-demand syncing with Nextcloud and Obsidian.,"On my Windows desktop, I have my Obsidian vault pointed directly to my Nextcloud virtual folder (the one that exists in the bottom-left pane of Windows File explorer and is created via a Windows Shell Namespace Extension).

This works flawlessly on my desktop. Although Obsidian wants to try and sync all my files at once, which i won't allow due to the limited storage on my desktop, I can just reject the syncing request, and Obsidian will only see the virtual files. It will only sync/download the files when I try to open them outright.

I'm trying to do the same thing on my Android device, but I'm at my wit's end. For some reason, Android does not allow Obsidian to access the Nextcloud document provider that is often seen in the files app.

Instead, Android only allows Obsidian to see folders in my phone's main internal storage directory (/storage/emulated/0).

I've tried using syncthing-fork, roundsync, and the remotely save community plugin, but they all run into the same problem: they want to download my entire nextcloud server. My phone doesn't have the storage for this. I just want my syncing app to do what the nextcloud desktop client app does: present virtual files (containing only metadata) to Obsidian so that Obsidian can see the file structure, and only download/sync files on-demand when I want to access them.

1mzx3nq,Help with Date Format issues - Daily Note / Dataview,"Hello! 

I’m running into some errors with my date formatting choice that is making it hard to keep things showing up or working consistently across my daily note template and in things like dataviewjs.

I’m just starting to add some features I like from other vaults I’ve seen around here and YouTube. Specially I’m trying to create the ‘Life Progress bar in Obsidian Using Template Variables’ as shown in Mike Schmitz channel. (Here is the link if that helps: https://youtu.be/7XZlLAYGi0U?si=6OuzLcZSHHsWR4En)

Walking through the steps, I can get it working up until I try and get the dates to appear as such:

Example: **2025-08-25 - Monday**

I would like to have the date name added to the back end like this as when I’m going back through my daily notes, I want to be able to determine at a glance what specific date of the week it was as well. I’m hoping that it will help me pinpoint any trends in my writing habits if for instance I manage to get more done on the average Monday vs. the average Thursday.

I think it has something to do with the fact that standard Date Formatting in Obsidian would be something along the lines of **YYYY-MM-DD - dddd** while trying to get the same rendered format in Dataview is something along the lines of **yyyy-MM-dd - cccc**.

I’ve tried trouble shooting with the help of Google Gemini, but after a few chat attempts, it basically said:
 *‘I don’t know bro, I tried my best, ask the Community- I hear they’re cool.’*

I am sort of learning code through trial and error this way, so let’s just assume I don’t know what I’m doing.
If you need more info in order to help, just let me know and I’d be happy to pass along what I tried with the code and the error messages, if need be.

1mzwwb3,Efficiently Managing Images in Obsidian Vaults (with Bases),"With Bases, and the desire to display a cover image for every card, I’m guessing that everyone’s vault will now experience a huge spike in stored images.

I’m wondering if you have any tips on how to manage images before things spiral out of control.

Currently, I’m trying to resize images linked to Bases down to the smallest possible size so that my vault doesn’t blow up in size due to all these images.

Wondering if I should have image folders for each Base so that I can find them easily and delete the image folder if I decide to delete a Base.

Here are my thoughts.

- Resize and compress images to reduce file size before adding them to your vault.
- Use dedicated image folders per Base to keep images organized and enable easy deletion if a Base is removed.
- Host the images (e.g.,Local. - ChibiSafe, or Imgur, Dropbox) with links instead of embedding all images directly in your vault.
- Use image optimization plugins or tools within Obsidian that automatically compress or resize images on import.
- Maintain a consistent naming convention for image files to simplify searching and management.

It is possible, but it would be clutter and I don't think easier to manage, if I have tons of characters. That can apply to other things like worldbuilding ,etc...

1mzutf4,12 Bases Tips,"1. Hold and drag the icon of view to change the order - the topmost one becomes the **default view**.
2. **Right-click** the ""View"" button to start editing directly.
3. For Tables, you can adjust **row height** in the view settings; for Card views, you can set **cover images** and aspect ratios.
4. The ""X results"" button next to the ""View"" button is also **clickable**:
   * You can **limit the number** of displayed results here.
   * You can also **export** the Base's search results as a CSV file or copy them to the clipboard.
5. **Double-clicking** a column divider will auto-fit the width to the content. *(see image below)*
6. When a Base is placed **inside a note**, it uses that note as `this`; when placed in the **sidebar**, it uses the currently active note as `this`.
   * Check this article for more details:   [Bases: Displaying Notes in the Same Folder](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1mv1lqi/bases_displaying_notes_in_the_same_folder/)
7. Bases come in two forms: Code block embeds and standalone files. Both contain identical content and can be copied/pasted. **You can edit Base files externally with a text editor**.
8. It's recommended to use \`.base\` files for **easier reuse** across multiple notes.
9. Use the format \`\[\[basename.base#viewname\]\]\` to **directly reference a specific view**. This allows you to embed multiple views of the same Base in a single note.
10. When filtering, you can’t directly find the `tags` property, but you can use file -> **has tag** for filtering. More about tags: [About Tags in Bases](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1mqwu5t/about_tags_in_bases/)
11. If you have the ""Page Preview"" core plugin enabled, you can **disable** Bases' ""Require Ctrl to trigger preview"" option in settings. This lets you see and edit previews in real-time when **hovering over any note**. *(see image below)*
12. If the YAML frontmatter in your **Templater** template is mistakenly treated as ""note properties"", you can either use Filter to exclude templates folder, or replace `---` with `<% --- %>` in templates to avoid them being parsed as properties.

1mzuquo,I need help organizing 570 files with partially duplicated content,"I have 2 questions. I’ll start with the primary because the secondary is related. 

**Question 1:**

I’m completely overwhelmed. I have adhd and I started wanting to write a novel in April. I write my own stuff but use AI to get advice on my ideas, help with editing, do writer workshops, see some idea scenes or dialogs, describe what I’m visualizing and ask how that translates into words or vocab. 

Of course I tell myself “Dont start any more new chats until you work through this conversation from today and collect notes you want to keep.” Do I do that? No. 

So I ended up with almost 3,000 notes across ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek. Once I filtered out just the ones related to my book + my drafts and non-AI notes it’s about 570. 

The problem is I’ve copied and pasted a lot across files trying to consolidate and when I ran a Python script to find duplicates there are like 15,000 duplicate groups (eg one paragraph across 6 files but the rest of their content is different). 

These files are anywhere from 10kb to 600kb and when I consolidated them all into one big file it’s 25MB. The file that shows every duplicate with preview, file names, and line numbers is 250MB. 

I’ve tried WinMerge, DiffChecker, Beyond Compare etc and none of these work on this specific problem I have. Python script risks splitting up matched paragraph from their context or I can do an interactive one that goes one by one but that would take forever. 

Yesterday I archived that vault and started a new one. I downloaded all of the AI chats again to catch the most recent and I think there’s 1200 because I have to parse further. I’m afraid to work the archive files because something may be missing. 

I put them all in the vault with the previous files that were in the vault to try to go through each one by one by hand but I’m stressed and it’s eating memory. 

I can’t even write efficiently without all of my notes organized to reference and a lot of the stuff in the notes is not needed. ChatGPT told me to use backlinks and such but I’m still learning Obsidian and can’t even focus on building a system like that with this many notes. 

Please tell me there’s a better method to this that’s adhd friendly. I’ll also take any Obsidian and organizing tips if you have them. 

**Question 2:**

How do I organize my Vaults in iCloud? With this many notes and other vaults it’s using a lot of resources to load. Every time I open on pc or iPhone it has all the vaults in the left panel. I created new vaults and moved the files over and that seemed to work but it seems like there must be a better way. Do they have to stay under the Obsidian path in drive or can they go anywhere?

1mzu4vl,Plugin for specific tab behavior?,"Hi, I'm looking for a community plugin which changes the tab behavior when clicking links:

Say I have a link in tab A which links to a heading in tab B, clicking the link will replace tab A with tab B, even if I have both tabs open.

I would like a plugin which changes the tab behavior so that when clicking the link in tab A, before opening the linked note, it checks if the tab is not already open (and if it is, it switches focus to that tab and scrolls to the heading), and if it's not, it behaves as normal.

1mzqwyg,I'm running out of option: how can I create a task-friendly table in Obsidian?,"Hi everyone!

For the context, I'm trying to create a vault in order to validate my degree in a paramedical field (SLP). I want to create an organization tool for SLP students, and then evaluate if it helps them with the mental load and other things. After some research, I decided to go with Obsidian, because it's more respectful of the General Data Protection Regulation (I'm in Europe, that's why) than Notion, and I had the feeling that there were a lot of custom options!  
But rn I'm stuck on a point, and I have the feeling that I reached all the solutions :( So I thought that it could help me to have other POV on my problem. So here's the thing:

* One of the goals of this vault is to gather all the ""to-do"" in one place. So I have a Kanban board + Reminder plugin. This plugin is really useful because visually I have all the things on the side, there are pop-ups, and it's pretty easy to use.
* Then, I have patients' notes, where I created a table to write what I did during the session (we can see the patient 1 to 4 times a week, so that's why we have to keep up with what we did, it helps prepare the next one). So my table has 4 columns: Date (of today's session) | What we worked on | What we used | Observations. Then I wanted to add one more, ""What to do for the next session"", as tasks so I could set up a due date. And that’s how I discovered that checkboxes are not compatible with tables, yay.
* I searched for alternatives to tables, but I didn't find anything conclusive. I tried HTML but it's too visually complicated for students; if I don't want to lose them, I have to find something easy to use with less visible code :/
* I tried to create tabs in the note (Tabs plugin) with the idea to have one tab for the table, and one tab for the tasks. But it uses Dataview so I gave up.
* I tried the checklist plugin because we can use #todo, but it doesn't work without checkboxes.
* And the Tasks plugin needs checkboxes too, from what I saw.

And here I am, idk what to try next. I think my last option left is to create one section with my table, and another section with my tasks (like ## Resume --> Table and ## To-do for the next time --> Tasks), but it's not really efficient and a little bit disappointing imo. It's important for me to have the same visual as a table, like all the sessions line by line, because it's easier to catch what we did during previous sessions.  
So if you think about something that can help me, I'll take it! And even if you want to give your opinion about another way to present it, go ahead. Thanks in advance for your advice and have a good day!

1mzql1b,General vault folder structure & combining bases with MOCs,"Hi, I wanted to ask for tips & ideas about your general vault folder structure and how you deal with MOCs now that bases are available.

I've used Obsidian for a couple years now and my vault had pretty much no folders other than one for journal entries, book reviews and some utility stuff like templates & attachments. While that worked okay for me so far, I've decided to try & re-structure and clean up my vault a bit - so for those of you that use folders, **could you share your general folder structure and the ideas behind it?**

Concerning **MOCs**: how do you deal with them now in combination with bases. Let's say I have my book-reviews folder with all individual reviews as a file. Up until now I had one main MOC called book-reviews in this directory with several linked files for each year - and in those files I had the actual reviews linked so they'd have a logical structure - in the graph for example.  
But it seems like bases can also cover this functionality now - I can have a base for all my book reviews and filter them in multiple views for each year. **How do you deal with that - do you just use both?**

**Overall I'd just love some general tips/examples how you're structuring your vaults - things like your basic directory structure, especially in combination with bases.**

1mzpf77,Advice and review on sync/backup setup for a beginner,"I’m a current Notion user looking for a better solution to host my notes. I’m not a tech expert—just a beginner—so it’s hard for me to understand the implications of different solutions. I am looking for sync and a backup solution.

I want something easy to manage day-to-day (ideally zero intervention after initial setup), controlled by the user (unlike Notion), and with minimal risk of sync conflicts.

As I understand it, there are three main options: Syncthing, Git, and cloud-based sync tools (rclone, etc.) for sync 

- Syncthing looks solid: light setup, cross-device support, and peer-to-peer sync. My main question is how it handles conflicts—anything I should know?
- What are the advantages of Git over Syncthing? I understand Git gives history and versioning, but is Syncthing’s built-in versioning sufficient for restoring accidentally deleted or broken notes? I don’t want something overly complicated + that requires a third-party Git provider (I won’t self-host a Git repo), so it don't think it's a good solution for me. I am right?


I also want a backup solution : the  cloud one with a defined frequency look easy and reliable. I may later add encryption for privacy, but it’s not a priority now, I just want a working setup ( and my understanding is that encrypting a folder before pushing to cloud isn’t too difficult).

1 Month ago i was surfing on this community and saw a project about an interactable ui made with dataviewjs

I decided to take that which had barebone function and with the help of a stupid but handy LLM i upgraded the version and a lot of things to make it look like on the github images. Even with the help of the LLM it was a lot of work.

The work is done if you're italian or use the italian language, if not you have to translate some bits and adjust your obsidian pathways to make it all work

After the bases i made up my mind that it was too flashy and heavy and i wanted something more simple and so the bases is what i was searching. Nevertheless i don't want to throw all my work on a bin so i shared it hoping someone would find this usefull

There are three seperate notes with the dataviewjs script and are all different because all three version have something different

1mzmgou,"I wrote a plugin to support many pandoc-markdown lists, and more","I want to share a plugin I've been working on, [Pandoc Extended Markdown](https://github.com/ErrorTzy/obsidian-pandoc-extended-markdown). I started building it because I do a lot of academic writing (mostly philosophy) in Obsidian, and I was struggling to structure my arguments and cross-reference them efficiently. It’s not officially in the community store yet, so it has to be installed via BRAT or manually.

My main goal was to replicate some of the list and referencing features I missed from tools like LaTeX, but keep it all within Obsidian's clean interface, and make sure it works well with pandoc so that it can cleanly be converted to docx or pdf.

# Plugin Features

1. **Beyond pandoc: Custom Label Lists**

https://preview.redd.it/7w2ye76u35lf1.jpg?width=814&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=443473fce26ec82a2248ddaa264f7bb36b235554

I constantly need to write out premises and conclusions like (P1), (P2), (C). So pandoc extended lists are not enough for me: the only list that supports cross reference is example lists, but I want to add more label to it. So I created my own syntax `{::C}` that automatically renders as (C); And I added auto-numbering system `{::P(#a)}` and any `(#placeholder)` will be automatically numbered. It makes formalizing arguments much cleaner. I believe this is the most useful part of this plugin, so I put it at first. This custom syntax works well with pandoc export with my lua filter CustomLabelList.lua.

All other features below are compatible with pandoc out of the box, without needing to apply a lua filter:

2.  **Example Lists with Cross-Referencing**

https://preview.redd.it/3fp2eh0v35lf1.jpg?width=819&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a429b73d0a74efbaae4db365b2fc58162400e8e9

Another frequent task is creating numbered examples and referring back to them. Manually re-numbering everything when you add or remove an example is a huge pain. This plugin lets you create a labeled example like `(@good-example)` and then reference it later with the same tag. The plugin automatically handles the numbering, so `(@good-example)` will always point to the right number, no matter how much you edit the list.

3.  **Autocomplete for References**

To make referencing even easier and avoid typos, I added an autocomplete suggestion box. When you type `(@` or `{::`, a list of all the labels you've created in that file will pop up, showing a preview of the content so you can pick the right one.

4.  **A Sidebar Panel for Overview**

When a document gets long, it's easy to lose track of all the arguments and examples you've created. I added a sidebar panel that shows all your labeled lists from the current note in one place. You can click on an item in the panel to jump straight to it in the editor, which is great for navigation.

5.  **Other Pandoc Fancy Lists and Formatting**

https://preview.redd.it/mhtboj8w35lf1.jpg?width=492&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf8d3030a96e76affc14abeacb39af80fc27f50a

The plugin also supports other Pandoc list styles, like Roman numerals (`I.`, `i.`), uppercase/lowercase letters (`A.`, `a)`), and auto-numbering with `#.` It also handles superscripts (`^text^`) and subscripts (`~text~`), which are common in academic texts.

The plugin's architecture probably needs to be refactored for better extendibility (documented at ARCHITECTURE.md), but currently I probably have no time doing such a huge refactor. My current interest is mostly in live preview mode, and reading mode may not have the best style.",3,1.0,0,2025-08-25 10:08:16+00:00,Errortzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1mzmgou/i_wrote_a_plugin_to_support_many_pandocmarkdown/,https://reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1mzmgou/i_wrote_a_plugin_to_support_many_pandocmarkdown/,,True,2025-08-26 03:10:13.831649+00:00,workflow_showcase,0.8,1,1,"Advanced users are extending Obsidian's capabilities to replicate features from powerful, specialized tools (like LaTeX) for academic writing.; The focus on Pandoc integration and clean export options indicates a demand for robust text processing and document generation within a note-taking environment.",This showcases a power user creating complex workflows by leveraging plugins to bridge gaps between Obsidian and traditional academic writing tools.

1. **Art gallery**: display images (supports static and dynamic images, and videos as single frame)
2. **Dashboard**: use icons (with or without Iconic or Iconize plugins) and pin nodes to organize your ideas and easily spot subjects
3. **PhD and academic litterature**: change node names by using a property, truncate names that are too long, show only filenames for attachments, add external links by href and/or domain
4. **Startup**: use curved links to show bidirectional relationships, add types to the links and show their label, remove links based on their types, combine tags and properties filters with UI buttons
5. **Story building**: use CSS with extended selectors to change how texts are displayed
6. **System architecture**: changes nodes shapes based on multiple metadata, modify arrows visuals
7. **Movies**: use images, change nodes shapes, use graph analysis to color and resize nodes (directed, undirected or reversed graph)

1mz1vg6,Best way to organize multiple topics in one Obsidian vault?,"Hi everyone, I’m pretty new to Obsidian so I’m not sure if what I want to do is even possible. Right now I only have one vault.

My system is organized like this (screenshot attached):

* **Source material** → where I keep quotes and links to references.
* **Tags** → topics related to a note or a source.
* **Indexes** → when a tag grows too much and has many connections, I move it here and create sub-indexes.
* **Main notes** → where I actually do my own writing.

Originally, this vault was just for studying history, but lately I’ve also been getting into philosophy and writing, and I’d like to start a D&D campaign too.

I tried creating a new folder called **Fields**, which would contain “History,” “Philosophy,” “Writing,” and “D&D,” and then link those to the relevant indexes. For example, “History” only has 3 indexes right now, so in the graph it just appears as a really small node because it only has 3 connections.

Here’s my question:

* Is there a way to manually increase the size of certain nodes in the graph?
* Or is it possible to make Obsidian detect the connections from indexes to notes and tags so that the “Fields” nodes appear bigger?

1mynied,"Lost my Vault due to drive failure, taking the opportunity to organize without being burdened by an existing structure. Any Suggestions?","Hey! Up until recently I had a general purpose vault that contained almost all of my files from studies to projects and notes, to art studies, recipes, plans, goals, and more. Essentially the one vault to rule them all in my life.

My organization was rigid, but I think it was too rigid. I had some abomination mixture of Zettelkasten, PARA, and Johnny Decimal. Given I don't have the vault, I also don't have the spec for how I put this together or the philosophy it was meant to follow, but I remember always not using it because I didn't want to have to feel like I was doing paperwork.

I don't want to do what I've seen before where all files are in one or two folders with no organization and only links, but at the same time I do not want sub-directories on sub-directories on sub-directories.

Any suggestions on how to create a structured yet flexible vault?

EDIT:

I spent some time after posting this brainstorming and figuring out my problems with my last vault. 

I came to the conclusion that I very much overengineered my last vault. I saw all the cool systems in this sub and saw everyone hyping them up and assumed if I engineered an organization system like the ones I was seeing that I would make my brain more organized too. The actual outcome was that I ended up not wanting to use my vault. 

To avoid that again, I needed to recognize most crucially that my brain is disorganized. I need to work with that, not try and defy it until it yields. So any strict organization systems like JD are inherently not  going to work for me, at least not without intention, which does not work for when I just need to dump my metaphorical ram into a note(s).

Here's what I came up with - PARA didn't work for me because I don't really differentiate between areas and projects very well, so I'll just make projects as a part of areas. My Making area might have 3d models in them under a directory for planning that project, and may also have general notes for how I prefer to work with certain plastics. My Art area might have my daily sketches, as well as observations of certain artists. With that problem solved, I'm left with ARA, which is structured and does not include any disorganized place. To solve that, I'm dedicating an entire top level domain to just slap random information in there. Random web clipping? In the scattered notes section. Got a cool site I wanna revisit? In scattered notes. Got an observation about a cool stick I saw and want to remember? Scattered Notes.   
  
My top level domains end up looking like a SARA then, which for me I think will work. Scattered notes for my disorganized information, Areas for things like Journaling, Making, Health, etc. that are living documentation but I'd like to be able to parse, Resources for hard facts and information that does not change, things like requirements for plants in my  garden, and then Archive for things that may not be relevant to me anymore but I \*may\* need at some point in the distant future (just another disorganized domain tbh).

Also yes, I know I need to backup. I had backups, but my github repo got too full and wouldn't let me push without paying and I procrastinated spinning up a git server on my local environments. The last commit was a couple years  ago and most of the notes I needed were from the last couple months, so I won't just be restoring from that repo.

1mxucnp,Why Obsidian is so good - from an unhappy Notion user,"Just discovered Obsidian today and I am completely stoked with how good it is.

First, the editor is so lightweight and feels fast. Notion always felt slow and not like a code or text editor.

I love that it accepts markdown and HTML/CSS, as a former web designer, this is a godsend.

I love that it all works locally. No storing of private information in the cloud.

Finally, the UI! I love the windowing, community themes (Notation theme ftw!) and just how damn clean it is. I want this thing open on my desktop at all times, whereas I would dread opening Notion.

Two learnings in my first day:

1. Start with one vault for everything first, don't try to use multiple vaults to separate note types (unless you have some privacy based reasons such as a need for work/personal vaults) , instead use filtering and folders to organise your notes.
2. Bases aren't exactly the same as Notion databases. They have access to all your notes in your vault and become useful as a filtering system to organising your notes, not a self contained parent with child notes. To recreate a somewhat Notion like experience, create a folder with your notes, then create a base within that folder and hit filter > where file >  in folder > your folder.

1mxxufo,Seeking curious pioneers to try a brand-new quick notes app built for Obsidian (iOS & Android),"Hey everyone,

Long-time Obsidian fan here. I first stumbled across it on YouTube back in the early release days, and it was love at first sight.

But there’s always been one thing that bugged me: whenever I just wanted to scribble something down fast on mobile or quickly share something into Obsidian, it always felt like there was friction. Since official quick capture wasn’t yet available, I decided to take on the challenge and build my own app.

I’ll admit, I spent a shamelessly long time hacking away at it—tweaking and adjusting things. It just didn’t feel right to release a half-baked MVP. For months, it was my private little tool, helping me get thoughts into Obsidian faster. Now, I finally feel ready to share it with the community.

**Feature highlights:**

* Attachments: images, videos, documents, files, and photos
* Voice recording with best-in-class transcription
* Text recognition from images or handwriting into Markdown
* Add nearby places to your drafts
* AI writing tools
* Sharing support
* Widgets and shortcuts
* What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) Markdown editor
* No sign-in, no ads

1mxxrwe,Custom CSS for Bases cards is cool but limited,"I've converted my games backlog from the Projects plugin to Bases and I'm really happy with how it works. I was missing some of the visual customization that Projects allowed, so I created a custom CSS snippet to style the cards as I wanted. 

But due to almost all elements in the Bases Card view being **positioned absolutely**, it is very difficult to customize beyond changing colors and fonts.  Here I use `transform: translateY()` and override `top` or `left` with `!important` as well as hide the property labels. But this creates a bunch of empty space at the bottom that *you cannot get rid of*, as the height and vertical position of the cards is hard set.

I also used to tint the background color of cards based on the status (green for FINISHED, yellow for PLAYING, etc.) and this seems to be currently impossible, as CSS cannot target the text contents only. It would be nice if we were able to **add attributes to cards** based on values of properties and **override the height** and ideally the positioning in an easier way. 

I'm sure the team has a reason for laying out all the properties with absolute positions, but it would be nice if they used more classic CSS flex and grid layouts as it would make customization much more accessible.",124,0.97,16,2025-08-23 10:20:31+00:00,GreenDave113,https://i.redd.it/alfzrnn8pqkf1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1mxxrwe/custom_css_for_bases_cards_is_cool_but_limited/,showcase,False,2025-08-26 03:10:23.050874+00:00,feature_request,0.4,3,3,"Users are pushing the boundaries of visual customization in Obsidian's 'Bases' (database-like feature), but hitting limitations.; The desire for more granular control over card styling (height, background color based on attributes) is a recurring theme for users seeking aesthetic personalization.; The inability to target text content for styling and the hard-set card heights are specific technical constraints hindering user creativity.","Obsidian's custom CSS capabilities, while powerful, are hitting practical limits for visual customization, particularly within its database-like features ('Bases').

1my9ryt,Programmers - how do you structure your notes?,"Hi,
I‘m a professional software developer and try to take my notes with the PARA principal with project, area, resource and archive. I‘m always struggling where to place my notes for area and resources. 

Do you have other structures? What can you recommend?

I don’t want to over engineer this but want to have some kind of simple structure. 

Edit: my main notes are for different frameworks and programming languages, my work and private projects and stuff I’m interested in but not needed every day like devops or security topics. And also my weekly notes",23,1.0,9,2025-08-23 18:55:14+00:00,matt_callmann,https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1my9ryt/programmers_how_do_you_structure_your_notes/,https://reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1my9ryt/programmers_how_do_you_structure_your_notes/,,True,2025-08-26 03:10:23.050877+00:00,help_support,0.3,2,2,"Professional software developers are seeking structured methods for organizing their notes, with a focus on efficiency and scalability.; The PARA method is a common framework, but users are struggling with its practical application, particularly for 'area' and 'resource' notes.; There's a demand for simpler, yet effective, note-structuring strategies beyond rigid methodologies.","Many developers are looking for systems to manage technical knowledge, project-specific information, and learning resources.
