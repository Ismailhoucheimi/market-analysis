1mzs1me,"A Deep Dive into the ""Spaghetti Problem"" of Complex Notion Workspaces","Hello r/Notion,

Like many of you, I use Notion as a ""second brain."" But as my system grew with dozens of interconnected databases, I realized I had accidentally created a ""spaghetti mess."" I could feel the connections through relations and rollups, but I couldn't *see* the architecture. It was a black box.

This isn't just about aesthetics; it has real consequences:

* **Onboarding is difficult:** How do you explain a complex system to a new team member?
* **Hidden Dependencies:** A small change in one database can unknowingly break a workflow somewhere else.
* **Information Silos:** Databases become ""orphaned"" and forgotten, leading to outdated knowledge.

**My Approach to a Solution: Systems Thinking**

I decided to tackle this not as a software problem, but as a *systems problem*. The goal wasn't just to plot databases on a screen, but to create a visualization that was genuinely useful and intelligent.

My philosophy was based on two principles:

1. **Intelligent Layout:** The graph shouldn't be a random cloud of nodes. I developed a custom layout engine that uses algorithms inspired by graph theory (like simulated annealing) to actively untangle the connections, minimize line crossings, and reveal the underlying structure.
2. **Connection Analysis:** Not all relations are equal. The system also needed to analyze the *strength* of connections to identify which databases are true ""hubs"" in the workspace and which are merely satellites.

Here is a look at the dashboard I've been building based on these principles.

As you can see, the goal is to provide a clean overview of the system's architecture. But a static map isn't enough. The tool is interactive and built for deep analysis. For example, you can:

* **Search and Filter:** Instantly find specific databases by name or property, allowing you to focus only on the parts of the system you need to see.
* **Isolate ""Orphaned"" Databases:** A key feature is the ability to quickly identify and isolate databases that are not being interconnected, helping you find valuable knowledge that has lost its connection to your system.
* **Export Your Architecture:** Export the visual map of your workspace to different formats (like PNG or SVG) to include in documentation, presentations, or team reviews.

I'm sharing this deep dive because I'd love to get feedback from other power users on this *approach* to solving the problem. Do these principles resonate with the issues you face?",11,0.79,7,2025-08-25 14:30:24+00:00,One-Engine-1287,https://i.redd.it/oloqj2vkb6lf1.png,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mzs1me/a_deep_dive_into_the_spaghetti_problem_of_complex/,üß© API / Integrations,False,2025-08-25 21:33:49.733212+00:00

1mzpprz,I will try to sell you my digital habit tracker!,"Hello guys,

First of all please don't be rush on me. I am new at this kind of things, and I don't know how to promote my hard worked product well since I don't have a good social media account as well. You don't have to buy to support me, your constructive feedback or any recommendation will be as valuable, and will be appreciated.

So, I am here to give it a shot and promote you the habit tracker I created in about a week, without copying anyone's work or AI's work (except for the formula and script). Here are the features I placed in my habit tracker:
________
For Google Sheets --> So you need only a Google account. Compatible with all devices and operation systems. NOT FOR NOTION!

Smart setup --> just enter your month, year, age, and gender. The calendar auto-adjusts to the right number of days, highlights today and show the day names as a real calendar.
Sleep & hydration goals are auto-calculated using WHO recommendations according to your age and gender. I believe it is a unique feature.

Define up to 30 habits --> each with custom goals & 11 categories to choose from.

Category tracking --> you can track the progress of the categories in addition to the habits with progress bars and donut pie. I didn't see other trackers do it like that so far. 

Instant progress tracking --> daily check-ins with color-coded bars for habits as well as for days. Auto percentages & progress bars update as you go. They also adapt to your goal and number of habits.

Gamified medals system --> earn bronze, silver, gold medals for each habit and also for each day. Daily medals check your consistency consistency based on how many habits you completed in a day.

Sleep & Hydration Tracker --> auto-goals based on your age & gender. Color-coded daily entries + monthly line graph for trends.

One-click PDF export --> have monthly reports automatically with the right month/year in the filename.

Easy reset button --> cears all checkboxes with a safety check, so you don't accidentally clear your progress.

Everything in one tab --> people promote as more than is better, but I think it is the reverse for simplification. No need to click around multiple sheets in my tracker.

Reusable forever --> just change the month/year, reset, and you‚Äôre ready to go again. 
________

Alright this what I have for you. I believe it has some unique features that other habit trackers don't have like easy cleaning, printing to PDF, auto wellness goals and category tracking instead of only habits. I might be wrong but this is what I saw so far. Gamification is also not very common, and I think it makes it more fun to develop habit or routines üòÄ

I sell it with 50% discount on Etsy now as a kick off. (Anywhere else as a recommendation?) Don't be scared when you see my store with no comment or stars. I opened my account 12 years ago, tried selling some other stuff 2 times but couldnt do well. So, I am trying again with my own product now. Here is the link to check it out.

1mzoaq6,5 Years with Notion: An Honest Take - but perhaps I am using my Notion PARA setup wrong.,"# Been using Notion for 5 years now and I'm stuck in the same frustrating cycle. Maybe others can relate?

**The endless loop:**

1. Spend hours/days tweaking Notion to fit my workflow perfectly
2. Use it enthusiastically for a few weeks/months
3. Gradually stop engaging with the complex setup
4. End up just using it as a glorified knowledge database
5. Get fed up and start over with a new setup
6. Repeat infinitely

**My biggest gripes:**

Notion is simultaneously too powerful and too finicky. The customization options are overwhelming, but more importantly, things constantly break or don't show up because I missed some obscure filter setting or database property. I'll be looking for a note I KNOW exists, only to discover it's hidden because of some view configuration I forgot about.

It *could* be perfect, but it's not. The gap between potential and reality is maddening.

**What I actually want (and what's inevitable):**

A truly intelligent, zero-setup productivity system. Something that:

* Automatically summarizes my meetings and schedules follow-ups
* Reminds me of tasks based on context from my emails/messages
* Tracks projects without me having to build elaborate database schemas
* Just... works without constant maintenance

Right now I'm experimenting with ChatGPT Projects as a super basic version of this vision. I dump everything into it and get contextually aware responses based on my evolving knowledge base. No setup, no maintenance, just intelligence.

**The bottom line:** I'm done with apps that require me to become a database administrator just to track my life. The technology exists for something better - we just need someone to build it.

Anyone else feeling this Notion fatigue?

My template is to help part-time entrepreneurs turn chaotic side hustles into organized, guilt-free operation that actually makes progress‚Äîeven with limited time.

* Scattered notes everywhere
* Forgetting important tasks
* Feeling guilty about slow progress
* Not knowing what to work on next

* Centralized place for everything important
* Clear priority system (what's urgent vs. what makes money)
* Built-in mental hacks that actually work

Is there a sort of ""hidden"" pages feature where the pages won't show up in the sidebar but will show up if I search for them? Or will I have to just bite the bullet and delete the irrelevant stuff now?

1mzb8ga,Importing Repeated from Google Calendar into Tasks,"Hey everyone! I recently switched over to Notion to better share my plans and habits with my accountability partner, and so far it's been great, but I‚Äôve run into one major issue.

I use two Gmail accounts: one for personal stuff like doctor‚Äôs appointments, and another for work and interviews. Most of my meetings are scheduled through Google Calendar and often include meeting links and recurring events.

I‚Äôm trying to pull these calendar events into Notion, but it looks like Notion has trouble syncing recurring events from Google Calendar. On the flip side, I¬†can¬†create recurring tasks directly in Notion, and they do show up in Notion Calendar, which I‚Äôm planning to use as my main calendar moving forward.

Just wondering if anyone‚Äôs found a good workaround for importing events? I would think that there should be a way to have the Google Calendar events imported directly into the Notion Database, but can't seem to find the settings. Would love to hear how others are handling it.

1mz5hfv,Making an Hourly Scheduler In Notion With Repeat Database Entries,"Hey everyone, 

Curious if someone can offer their expertise on this. 

I'm creating a Notion page that I want to use to track my radio program. What I have so far is a database that holds entries for specific days (Monday's show, etc) that sets the daily date automatically. Then inside I'd like to have two columns, on where I can grab a page with a prepped break filled with information, and then move it over to the other side and drop it into a filtered linked view of the same database and it categorizes itself based off of the hour (say 6am) and the time during that hour/break number (break 1, break 2, etc). I have a system that works pretty good, but if I want to put the same break in say 6am - Break 1, as well as 7am - Break 3 I can't seem to find a way to do that without it messing up all the filters. I've tried having the ""break numbers"" in a multi select, but that doesn't seem to work.

1mz415i,Everyone has messy Notion workspaces :(,"I got tired of being lost in my own Notion workspace. Made something to fix it. Looking for 5 beta testers

Hey r/Notion,

I've lurked here for months and see the same pain everywhere: 

We build amazing systems in Notion, then can't figure out what we actually built.

The breaking point? I spent 3 hours last weekend trying to trace why deleting one rollup would break my entire finance tracker.

We need more than database views and filters. We need to see the big picture, 

how everything connects, what depends on what, where our data actually flows.

So I built something: :)

a tool that scans your workspace and shows you the complete map of your database relationships.

Here's what it found in my ""simple"" setup:

- 14+ databases I forgot I had
- Rollup chains 4 levels deep  
- Formula dependencies I never realized existed

The graph shows clusters of related databases. Click any node to see what it connects to. 

Finally understand the monster you created.

Now I'm looking for 5 people from this community to test it out and give feedback.

 Especially interested in:

- Complex workspace owners (50 +  databases)
- People who use lots of rollups/formulas
- Anyone who's ever been scared to delete something

----> Drop a comment if you're interested. Will DM the first few people.

 trying to build a solution :)

1mz2znv,Do we underestimate how far Notion can go when pushed to its limits?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been obsessed with pushing Notion beyond what it was designed for. Over the past months I poured more than 900 hours into building a system that doesn‚Äôt feel like a template anymore ‚Äì more like a complete operating system for life and work.

It‚Äôs fully modular, has 4 core hubs (Focus, Health, Finance, Growth), 20+ embedded AI prompts, and more than 1,500 curated visuals to make it actually feel like a designed product. I wanted it to have the clarity and elegance of something you‚Äôd expect from an Apple launch, but inside Notion.

The result is a space where everything connects: projects, habits, meals, workouts, finances, networks, even travel. It‚Äôs not about stacking databases, it‚Äôs about having one consistent architecture where life just makes sense.

I‚Äôm super curious what you all think:
‚Äì Has anyone else here tried to build something that ambitious in Notion?

1mz2z1n,Notion really needs a ‚ÄúUser Mode‚Äù (separate from Edit Mode),"Hey Notion community,

I wanted to share a feature idea that I think could make Notion vastly more usable for everyday workflows. The problem is: **there is no way to separate ‚Äúcreator mode‚Äù from ‚Äúuser mode.‚Äù**

Right now, everything in Notion is always editable, which is great for building, but becomes distracting when you just want to use your tables, databases, or dashboards. Every interaction invites you to tweak properties, formulas, and layouts. For people trying to focus, this constant temptation can make task management stressful or inefficient.

The solution is simple but powerful: **Notion should have a ‚ÄúUser Mode‚Äù or ‚ÄúInteraction Mode.‚Äù**

Here‚Äôs what it could look like:

* Enter **Edit/Creator Mode** to configure databases, properties, formulas, views, and automations.
* Exit Creator Mode to simplify the interface: only elements you want interactive remain so (checkboxes, buttons, links, etc.). All other editing controls stay hidden unless you switch back.
* Users decide which parts of their setup stay interactive and which are locked.

This would effectively turn complex Notion setups into clean, usable apps for daily work, while keeping all the customization power intact. It‚Äôs like giving creators and users two separate experiences in the same workspace.

No other tool currently combines:

* Deep customization and flexibility
* Clean, distraction-free interaction
* The ability to selectively lock or hide editing controls

If implemented, this could make Notion **the ultimate productivity tool** for personal and team use. I hope the Notion team considers this‚Äîhaving a ‚ÄúUser Mode‚Äù would be a game-changer.

1myxzoc,Just launched To-Do widget for Android,"I was frustrated by the lack of an Android widget for my to-do lists, so I made one.  It's completely free and I don't have access to any of your Notion data.  Everything is kept on your device.

You can [download it here from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radiantmaple.whim).

Thank you to all of my beta testers who helped identify all the bugs so I could fix them.  Whim is now released in production!

**How it works**

It connects to your Notion account on first launch.  After you're connected, add a widget to your home-screen and it will ask which database you want to show.  You can choose any database that has a checkbox and a text column.  The widget will show all of your unchecked tasks as well as your ten most recent checked tasks.  You can check and uncheck tasks from the widget and it will sync with Notion.  The widget supports both light and dark mode.

Here's a [short video of it working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Il9XPrCpzY) and here's a quick screenshot of the widget

1myhtjt,Creating spreadsheet for production management,"I‚Äôm researching options for a database and wondering if Notion is the right option for me. 
Note, computers are not my forte - for context, before moving into my current work role using Excel / Google sheets four years ago, my previous spreadsheet encounters were with Windows 95. ü§™
I‚Äôve learned and relearned a lot, YouTube and Google have been my best friends. üòÇ
I don‚Äôt know the lingo or how to explain this any better, so I apologise for the lengthy explanation and question!

My job is to manage the workflow for the production of custom made jewellery. I manage around 150 jobs at any given time. 
I‚Äôm using Google sheets with the following fields: client, designer, due date, current stage, stage due, next stage, and two additional columns to note the date a procedure has been outsourced or a part ordered and to / from whom. 
Each client has a row, so the spreadsheet is approx 150 rows long. 
My issue is that I‚Äôm sure my workload has outgrown this format. I need to rely on a database giving me prompts for things being due, staying stagnant for too long, etc, rather than just reflecting where something is currently at. I‚Äôm hoping for a lot more automation to make this tracking more efficient rather than being so manual and time consuming. 

I‚Äôve done a deep dive on project management software, Gantt charts, Kanban tables and the like, but none seem quite right. 
I love the way Notion appears to work, and the fact I can integrate a dashboard with daily tasks and other things, basically creating a hub for my work overall, as well as this spreadsheet. I also love the potential for automated functions - I can see for example that Zapier can talk to my CRM to autofill some things for me. 
But can a Notion table be set up to do what I‚Äôm asking? Or am I better off just using the dashboard functionality and linking it to my Google sheet which, in turn, I could potentially learn to better automate? I‚Äôm going around in circles and on many tangents with my YouTubing trying to find the answer. I‚Äôm searching templates but can‚Äôt find anything quite right, though I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just not using the right words (project management, production management, workflow). 
I appreciate any insights!

Any guidance is appreciated.,"I would like to be able to add a card as a to-do block to a category, in this case ""Lands"".

Also, I would like the card name to populate in its category on the ""Deck List"" table when checked, and get removed when unchecked. Since I'm not expecting anyone to have to spell this out for me, what concepts do I need to learn to make this happen, if possible? Any keywords or topics would be helpful for me.

1myc2zb,[very serious] Ideas for a people notion database. Give your best advice.,"I want to create a database based on my relationships and interactions with the people I know, and also with every person I‚Äôve ever crossed paths with in my life.

I am someone who records every aspect of my life‚Äîwhat time I ate, what time I slept, when I went to the bathroom, when I urinated, if I ran, if I jumped, etc.

So now I want to do the same, but with people. For example, if I had an interaction with a friend today, I would record everything we talked about in the database. But at the same time, I also want to have a database of people where I keep all their information: when they were born, where they live, what they do for a living, their vices, their addictions, their weaknesses, their strengths, their motivations, and so on.

In short, I would have a complete database of every human being that has been part of my life, so that in the future, if I ever need some information that could be useful to me, it would be there.

I would also include people I consider unwelcome.

1my7wss,"Roast my idea: Click and save any resource in the internet to your Notion DB. Summarize, categorize, get a transcript from YT video, scrape a website","Hey notion enthusiasts

I am building a tool for myself and some users on X which you would like.

It will be an integration which allow you to end doomscrolling.

Scope of work:
- you browse X, YouTube, whatever,
- you find a nice content,
- copy url,
- double tap on the back of the phone triggering apple shortcuts or send it through telegram or other interface (I am thinking about this),
- in the background app processes a content, summarizes it, categorizes it, etc.
- then it sends formatted content to Notion or other connected db, you store this informations or app, your choice of privacy 

For videos it can get a transcript and proceed it. There are endless of materials I would love to watch, but there is no time.

For tweets, it gets a tweet content‚Ä¶
We all know that bookmarking makes forgetting it.

For other pages, app scrapes them and summarizes.

There is also a huge potential to make automatic reports, weekly or daily you will get a summary of saved content.

Maybe even make AI chat with this content.

Research on another level.

I have built a prototype for myself and I would love to share it with others and make a product which will be valuable and help fight with endless scrolling.

If anyone is interested I will share a waitlist.

But upon navigating my notion, I realised I didn‚Äôt need another workspace and deleted the new workspace I created. Shortly afterwards, I logged out of my account on google chrome from my mac to log in via the desktop version.

On my notion desktop, I logged in with said account and suddenly everything was lost. I lost information on my university notes and assignments, class schedules, deadlines, and other personal management systems.

But what became the nail in the coffin for me was how I am also using notion to manage my club as a president. Now I‚Äôve lost my club‚Äôs operations database, membership details, fund allocations, Terms of Reference that I have been working on my whole semester break with my committee members.

I don‚Äôt know what to think, say, or do at the moment because this made me feel so bad. Especially when I also run my small business doing art commissions where I track everything on the app.

I have emailed Notion about my issue and have requested a ticket from their website. I hope I can  update you guys further with good news. As of now I can only vent. 

Speaking of my club, Semester is starting in like a week from now and I drafted all my necessary documents on notion for me to publish and send to the university department for review.

1my54o8,Recalling AI prompt,"I'm new to Notion. Forgive me for not RTFM but I did not see any obvious way to do this and reddit is faster & more accurate than my eyes anymore.    :) 

Using the AI prompt, using voice to text, Notion generated for me an interactive database for planetary systems in the game No Man's Sky. If not in the know, it's ...a lot.  
  
First of all:  Perforated Bovine!  This ai tool created a well fleshed out database for this purpose, integrating the lion's share of possible data points and with features that *I didn't ask for* but are intuitive and I eventually would have added in myself.    I had done a search prior to see if anyone had done this for Notion previously, with no results. When I saw the option for the AI prompt, I figured why not try and it popped out a gem, without being given anything other than the name the game. 

This old nerd is impressed. 

To my question, while I understand that I can tweak this manually, I'd like to keep exploring what this little hickey can do.   Is anyone aware of a way to recall the AI  prompt that generated a project in Notion?

Does anyone know if Notion has any plans to add a feature that can identify who‚Äôs speaking during a transcribed meeting? Ideally, it could either recognize the speaker directly or at least tag them as ‚ÄúSpeaker 1, Speaker 2,‚Äù etc., so you can later replace those with the actual names. That way, you‚Äôd be able to search specifically for what a certain person said in a meeting.

I‚Äôve used this feature in Krisp before and found it super useful, but paying for multiple app subscriptions just to get that one function feels like overkill. I‚Äôd really love to see it in Notion.

Also, does anyone know the best way to suggest feature requests to Notion?",1,1.0,0,2025-08-23 06:30:04+00:00,Takeoyoshi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mxu2t5/meeting_transcripts_with_speaker_identification/,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mxu2t5/meeting_transcripts_with_speaker_identification/,üì¢  Discussion Topic,True,2025-08-25 21:33:53.422948+00:00

1mxqk5d,I rebuilt my Product Discovery board in Notion template to make prioritisation actually transparent ‚Äî here‚Äôs how,"I recently overhauled my Product Discovery board in Notion with two goals:

1. **Efficiency** ‚Äî fewer clicks, faster comprehension.
2. **Transparency** ‚Äî anyone can see the rationale behind a story at a glance.

Here‚Äôs what changed:

* **Added context fields**: Problem statement, user impact, business impact, dependencies, risks, acceptance criteria.
* **Upgraded prioritisation**: Kept RICE, but you can add ‚ÄúStrategic Fit‚Äù and ‚ÄúRisk Reduction‚Äù for a more holistic score.
* **Linked source material**: User feedback, analytics dashboards, or research docs right in the card.
* **Clear status definitions**: ‚ÄúDiscovery,‚Äù ‚ÄúReady for Dev,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn QA,‚Äù ‚ÄúValidated‚Äù ‚Äî no more ambiguous ‚ÄúIn Progress.‚Äù
* **Visual context view**: Gallery cards with key info visible without opening them.

The result?

* Fewer ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù pings from the team.
* Faster alignment in planning meetings.
* Easier to defend prioritisation decisions to stakeholders.

I‚Äôve pre-filled it with a few example stories (Airbnb-inspired) so you can see how it works in practice.

I have four or five databases where I enter daily expenses according to category: formal expenses, informal expenses, waiter expenses, transportation expenses, etc.

Informal expenses only have a single value property, as do transportation and waiters, and then include them in the formula to display all the information in one place.



The thing is, now I find out that I have to create categories according to the percentage of the budget they have, so that I can bring them from the expenses, the budget database...

1mx5e0u,"Notion Mail Scheduling Hell: ""Link Still Loading"" Error Won't Let Me Send Emails ‚Äì Fixes or Workarounds?","Hey r/Notion,

I'm pulling my hair out over this Notion Mail bug and hoping someone here has run into it or knows a fix. I've been trying to use the 'Schedule Outreach' template (or just inserting a scheduling snippet) in Notion Mail, but every time I hit send, I get stuck with ""Scheduling link still loading"" message. The email never goes out.

Here's the weird part:

* My Notion Calendar is connected perfectly to Google Calendar ‚Äì no issues there.
* In Notion Mail, the mini-calendar view pops up fine, shows my Google Calendar events, and even lets me add availability slots without a hitch.
* But as soon as I try to finalize and send the email, it hangs on that loading error indefinitely.

I've already tried:

* Reconnecting Notion Calendar multiple times.
* Clearing cache, restarting the app/browser, and even trying different browsers.
* Manually creating scheduling links in Notion Calendar and pasting them in (still fails when sending).
* Ensuring all permissions are set in Google Calendar (public sharing, full access granted).

Imagine‚Äîno more juggling between Notion, Drive, or Dropbox. You literally drag-and-drop files and they're ACTUALLY stored¬†*inside*¬†a Notion Cloud storage, not just linked out.

**Why this would be revolutionary for cloud storage in Notion:**

* Instantly upload and organize all files‚Äîright in your workspace.
* Attach any doc or media, no external links needed.
* File permissions = Notion sharing. No broken access.
* Unified search finds every file instantly.
* Effortlessly link files across pages and projects.

No more app juggling, no more lost files. Just pure organization bliss.

1mx0q70,"Built a clean, all-in-one AI productivity system in Notion ‚Äî made for people who want less clutter","Hey everyone,

A few months ago I built a Notion-based system to simplify my own workflow ‚Äî combining tasks, goals, calendar, habits, and AI prompts all in one clean dashboard. I posted about it here back then and a few people ended up buying it, which honestly surprised me.

Since then I‚Äôve left it on the shelf while focusing on other things‚Ä¶ but I figured I‚Äôd share it one last time in case anyone missed it.

It‚Äôs called **Optimize**. It‚Äôs not bloated, it‚Äôs not pretending to be a second brain ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a clean and simple productivity system built in Notion, with:

* AI prompt libraries already integrated
* Habit + task + goal tracking in one view
* Smart views & filters for focused work
* Minimal, distraction-free UI



Not for everyone ‚Äî but if you‚Äôre into Notion and want an organized space that‚Äôs ready to go, you might like it.

üëâ You can preview it here: [Optimize](https://optimizeai.framer.ai)

I‚Äôm still keeping the **$19 offer** up (was $25) for now, but after this I‚Äôll probably stop promoting it.

1mx0jnt,"Is Notion enough for managing projects, teams, and clients? My setup's turning into a chaotic mess, and I'm wondering if it's just me.","I've been deep in Notion for a couple of years now‚Äîit's my go-to for personal brainstorming, quick wikis, and organizing random thoughts. But as my freelance work scaled up with a small team and actual clients, things started to get messy. I feel like I am losing control

My Tasks are scattered across databases, and deadlines that I have to manually chase because notifications feel hit-or-miss. Team chats mixed with emails and external tools, clients emailing for updates because sharing a Notion page feels too raw and unprofessional. No easy way to track time, generate invoices, or keep everything transparent without constant manual tweaks. My workspace is now this tangled web‚Äîpersonal notes are just wreaked into business stuff, nested toggles hiding ""sub-things"" that I forget exist, and everything just... misaligned. It's giving me that same vibe as the ""absolute sh\*t show"" posts I've seen here, where you think you're organized until you zoom out and see the labyrinth.

Don't get me wrong, I love Notion's flexibility, but for full-on project management, it feels like it's trying to be everything and ending up stretched thin. What I really crave is a setup where projects, teams, and clients are all together and aligned, without the constant fighting against the interface.

Like:

* A unified project dashboard that gives a centralized view of everything‚Äîtasks, resources, real-time updates, and key metrics‚Äîso I can make quick decisions without digging.
* Milestone and deadline tracking that's intuitive, not hacked together with properties.
* Task prioritization and custom statuses to fit how my team actually works.
* Centralized team communication to kill off scattered emails and chats‚Äîreal-time feedback, mentions, notifications, all in one hub.
* An integrated client portal for seamless updates and transparency, so clients feel in the loop without me sharing my whole Notion chaos.
* Real-time project updates and comprehensive reports with clear dashboards for better decision-making.
* Seamless app connectivity and integrations (like API stuff) to pull in data from other tools without breaking the flow.
* Automated time tracking, effortless invoice generation, and payments handling.
* Board and task views, document/file management, messages‚Äîbasically, everything in one place with a clean, aesthetic UI that doesn't stutter or lag.

Is Notion handling all this smoothly for you in team/client scenarios? Or are you patching it with Zapier hacks, external apps, or just suffering in silence? I've tried PARA and other systems, but it always spirals back to overload.

I just want to ask that would solution exist for something like this on notion? I will i need to get 3d pary softwares that are better at doing this? for example this [clcik](https://www.teamcamp.app/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=2025q3_1) and there are 50 more that I SAW JUST TODAY

What are your go-to hacks or alternatives when Notion falls short for this? Share your wins (or horror stories)‚Äîmaybe it'll save my sanity!

1mwv2nz,I made a free Content Library template that's integrated with an iOS Shortcut to organize your Instagram 'Saved' folder.,"Hey everyone,

My name's Kai. Like a lot of you, I'm a creator, and I've been trying to build a calmer, more intentional way to work inside Notion.

One of my biggest struggles was my Instagram 'Saved' folder. It was a complete graveyard for good ideas‚Äîhundreds of Reels saved for ""later,"" but impossible to find when I actually needed inspiration.

So, I built a system to fix it, and I wanted to share it with you all for free.

It's a minimalist **Content Library template**, but the real magic is that it's designed to work with a **one-tap iOS Shortcut**.

Here's how it works:

* You find an inspiring Reel on Instagram.
* You hit the ""Share"" button and run the shortcut.
* It prompts you to add your own notes and a category.
* In seconds, the Reel link and your thoughts are sent directly to this organized Notion database.

It‚Äôs been a game-changer for me, turning that chaos into a searchable, useful library.

The template is now live on the Notion Marketplace for free.

I'm building out a whole ""Creator's OS"" with more tools like this, so a follow on instagram ( [vznkai](https://www.instagram.com/vznkai/) ) would mean a lot if you find it valuable. Happy to answer any questions about the setup in the comments!

1mwpo1e,"Nice updates, would love quality of life changes and more!","It seems notion is finally making up for the promises they have made us.

Notion Offline and a updated console for formulas. But this is just the start. (If Notion made it so I could have it on my own system fully offline with small file size with a one time payment/Open source and better working export and connectable for newer updates I‚Äôd give in)

Custom color codes for style is a must for notion, users should not be limited to the basic default (it doesn‚Äôt even have black as a style for text. Have to use a workaround just to be able to use custom color squares)

Full Width for Card Size and Feed is a must (similar to feed but for the sole purpose of being able to showcase elaborate formulas on cards. Such as grid. Also giving a better view for Feed as the current card size view is just not enough)

More capabilities for formulas is a must (to be able to have and run certain formulas automatically)

An ability to write on a feed by clicking onto it and alter text properties (You can  already click toggles from feed, would be amazing if you could hit checkboxes and type inside a feed. No need to be able to drag things around)

A whiteboard property/basic block would do wonders they just don‚Äôt realize yet (Would give 5 stars for this feature alone and better pen capabilities)

Graph view of all your databases and pages (Which not only show connections but also the total count and filters for databases would be doing us justice. Making it more manageable, even a little bit more is more than enough)

Better customizable Home, with user design layouts would be great. (The wonders of being able to access the most important things in one main place)

Community Plugins! That alone would bring another wave of Notion users with how more robust it would become (More video content and capabilities)

1mwpblv,Integrating Slack Workflows with Notion Database for Customer Support,"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôve spent hours researching online but haven‚Äôt found a clear solution for the workflow I‚Äôm trying to build. 

I‚Äôm trying to set up a customer support system and could use some guidance on the technical implementation.

What I want to build:
- A customer support database in Notion
- Slack channel as the entry point for customers
- Customers submit requests via Slack Workflow (using channel buttons/forms)
- Workflow data automatically populates 

Notion database properties

Specific questions:
(1) How can I connect Slack Workflow outputs to Notion database entries?
(2) Is there a way to sync follow-up messages in the Slack thread to the corresponding Notion entry‚Äôs comments?

Has anyone built something similar? Any suggestions is welcomed!

1mwgsx1,Can Notion be a reliable backend for building apps?,"I know Notion is not meant to be a serious database solution when compared to traditional databases (like MySQL/Postgres) or modern back-end services (like Firebase or Supabase). I experimented by building some apps to see how much I could push it and what kinds of use cases it could realistically solve.

**Different ways to use Notion as a backend,**

* **Directly via Notion API:** Read/write data from your Notion databases into your custom-developed app. Works best if you want an app, customized and fully integrated into your existing tech stack.
* **No-code tools** (like [NotionApps](https://www.notionapps.com/), [Super](http://super.so/), etc): Build apps using a drag-and-drop tool that is in sync with Notion pages and databases. Great for lightweight business apps like client portals, internal dashboards, or field apps. 
* **AI Developer platforms** (like [Replit](https://replit.com/)): Vibe code your app while the platform takes care of the Notion integration. Great if you‚Äôre up for experimenting, are flexible with design, and don‚Äôt want to manage all the code yourself.

**Some real limitations,**

* **Performance:** Notion wasn‚Äôt built for high-frequency queries or complex relational operations. Large databases or apps requiring real-time updates experienced lag or slow responses.
* **Reliability:** The API has rate limits, and Notion itself can experience occasional downtime. For mission-critical apps, it won't be reliable.
* **Data structure:** Notion databases need to be carefully designed, especially relations and rollup properties. Messy or inconsistent databases can quickly break your app workflows.
* **Security:** Notion‚Äôs permission system is not equivalent to user auth of your app. For managing user access and sensitive data, you will either have to code your own auth layer or use a no-code tool that handles it. 

**Sanity checks if you take this route,**

* Keep your databases clean and structured with relations
* Scope your use case; it will not work if you have a million rows of data.
* Test rate limits, plan for batching requests for high-frequency operations.
* Manage permissions and authentication using a no-code tool or by custom coding.
* Version control and track schema changes, as even small edits can disrupt your app.

**Final verdict:** Notion can serve as a simple back-end for lightweight business apps, but if you‚Äôre trying to build a product with lots of logic, scale, or real-time needs, it is better you use traditional databases and sync data to your Notion.

Have you tried using Notion as a back-end? How did you approach it, and what worked (or didn‚Äôt) for you?

1mwccku,Automatically checking checkbox,"So I have a habits tracker, where I, for example, track the days I drink and the days I go without alcohol with a streak and everything. I don't really have a drinking problem, nor am I trying to quit or anything like that, but I find it easier to hold me accountable for my habits when I actually have them written down and accessible, also, my memory is actually terrible for this kind of things, so I like having trackers like this.

Thing is, mine is just a database for days (rows) with a checkbox for, in this case, alcohol (column), that I check manually if I do drink, and I wanted to go more advanced, but I don't know how to do it. It would be fun to add/check an alcoholic beverage/drink and quantity, and by adding/checking that, it automatically checks the box for alcohol. Example: I add 1 beer, it automatically checks I had alcohol for that day.

Same thing would be cool for, say, medicine, but instead of checking the medicine checkbox for the day automatically when checking for a single medicine, checking it only when all different medicine are taken. (I know that there are plenty of other apps that do that, even the iOS Health app, it's just an example and a mental exercise). 

Is it possible to do that? How would such a thing be possible? I don't even know how to proceed with the counting, if it should be a number property, or if it can be detected from text, or if it should be another checkbox for the specific beverage with no counting... if it is possible, I imagine the Alcohol property would then be a formula that outputs a checked checkbox, if so would I still be able to manually check it?

1mw9l5a,Question about selling a modified template (copyright concerns),"Hey everyone, I need some advice about a situation I‚Äôm in.

I bought a template a while ago, and since then I‚Äôve heavily modified it. I‚Äôve added a lot of new features, changed the structure of the database at its core, and overall made it very different in terms of function. The only part that‚Äôs mostly similar is the layout.

Here‚Äôs the tricky part:

* The original template creator included a lot of content with pictures.
* After digging, I found out that those pictures actually came from a website (not owned by the template creator).
* I rewrote the content myself based on my own knowledge, so the text is original now.
* However, I‚Äôd like to keep many of the same pictures for instructional purposes, since they fit really well. I *could* replace them with other images from the internet, but most of the ones I want are already in the template.

My plan is to sell this modified template, but I‚Äôm unsure whether keeping those pictures could cause copyright issues. Since the template creator used them from some website, does that make it risky for me to resell a version with the same images? Or would it be safer to replace them all with alternatives I know I can use?

Would love to hear your thoughts from anyone who has dealt with similar copyright/template situations.",0,0.2,7,2025-08-21 12:30:10+00:00,c6799,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mw9l5a/question_about_selling_a_modified_template/,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mw9l5a/question_about_selling_a_modified_template/,‚ùìQuestions   ,True,2025-08-25 21:33:53.423149+00:00

1mw8wsa,Notion for backpackers: Built a simple tracker to manage my camping gear,"Ever hit the trail, only to realize you forgot something essential? Me too.

It‚Äôs tough to keep track of all the little trinkets required for backpacking. To keep organized, I built a simple Notion¬†[inventory tracker](https://www.notion.so/Backpacker-Inventory-256547554d7480e8aa89c5b6b5487168?pvs=21), which I‚Äôm sharing here in case it‚Äôs useful to others.

**Goals:**

I wanted this tool to do three things:

1. Track shopping needs
2. Generate a packing list
3. Surface notes for upcoming trips

**How it works:**

* The landing page has three databases (**Kit**,¬†**Stats**, and¬†**Trips**¬†‚Äî linked in the bottom right corner) and three filtered views.
* The¬†**Kit**¬†database stores the inventory, with each item‚Äôs category, weight, and quantity. Checkboxes track whether an item is¬†*on hand*,¬†*worn*, or¬†*packed*.
* If an item is not¬†*on hand*, it appears in the¬†**Shopping List**.
* If an item is not¬†*packed*, it appears in the¬†**Packing List**.
* The¬†**Trips**¬†database stores trip records with fields for start/end dates, mileage, and country. New records follow a simple template with sections for goals, itinerary, and a bullet journal.
* Trips with a start date this year appear in¬†**Upcoming Trips**.
* The¬†**Stats**¬†database pulls metrics from¬†**Kit**¬†and¬†**Trips**. Right now, it only calculates base weight by summing all items that are not¬†*worn*, but it could easily be expanded to track gear value, total trip spend, or cumulative mileage.

**Initial testing:**

I used this system for the first time while prepping for the Tour du Mont Blanc. It worked! I remembered everything, and when I arrived in Chamonix, I knew exactly what I still needed to buy: a butane canister and lighter.

**Ideas for expansion:**

* Add gear prices in¬†**Kit**¬†and roll up to total value in¬†**Stats**
* Add expenses in¬†**Trips**¬†and track total spending in¬†**Stats**
* Track total mileage across all trips in¬†**Stats**

**Closing thoughts:**

It‚Äôs simple, but this tool has kept me more organized than anything else I‚Äôve used. Here‚Äôs the¬†[template link](https://www.notion.so/Backpacker-Inventory-256547554d7480e8aa89c5b6b5487168?pvs=21)¬†again if you want to give it a spin ‚Äî curious how others would tweak or expand it.

1mw8njd,I built a lightweight text capture extension because I was wasting half my time pressing Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V,"Hey folks üëã I‚Äôm a student and solo dev, and I wanted to share a side project I‚Äôve been working on:¬†[SelectSynth](https://selectsynth.me/), a Chrome/Edge extension that makes capturing and organizing web text much easier.

As a student, I was constantly copying quotes from Wikipedia, journal articles, and lecture notes into messy Google Docs, losing track of sources, and juggling way too many tabs. It felt like research was more about fighting with Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V than actually studying. So I built a tool to fix that.

# üîπ What SelectSynth does:

* **Highlight & save instantly:**¬†press¬†`Ctrl+Shift+S`,Select Any texts and it‚Äôs stored ,no more endless copy-paste.
* **Stay organized:**¬†View everything in a clean popup, favorite important snippets, and group multiple selections.
* **Export flexibly:**¬†Send your notes to plain text, JSON, or Markdown (great for Notion or Docs).
* **Optional AI tools:**¬†you can get summaries, keyword extraction, Q&A flashcards, and more.
* **Privacy-first:**¬†Everything stays local on your device. The only time data leaves is if you use the AI features.

# Who it‚Äôs for:

* **Students**: grab quotes and build study notes quickly
* **Researchers**: collect citations across tabs without losing them
* **Writers/Marketers**: save snippets of inspiration, trends, or examples

# üîπ Looking for feedback

I‚Äôd love to hear from this community:

* **What tools do you use for clipping / saving text during research?**
* **Would features like auto citation (APA/MLA) or direct Notion integration be useful?**

I‚Äôm currently launching early access, you can check it out at¬†[**selectsynth.me**](http://selectsynth.me/).

1mw4jjh,Conditional rules in forms on a Plus account,"Hi all,

I love my Notion account and have a paid Plus account.

The (expensive) level up primarily has a number of corporate things you‚Äôd need to use in a business (user accounts, SSO integrations etc)

However there‚Äôs on ‚Äúbasic‚Äù feature that‚Äôs not in Plus I‚Äôm finding really annoying.

Notion has ‚Äúforms‚Äù (like survey monkey or for filling in your own notes on the fly) and I use these a lot as part of my workflow.

However they‚Äôve removed ‚Äúconditional behaviour‚Äù specifically from forms in plus and moved it to professional.

This is VERY standard form behaviour, and eg for expenses allows you to have a question like ‚Äúdid you take the train or drive‚Äù and then hide all the train questions if you selected drive.

Does anyone know if there‚Äôs any chance Notion would consider extending this feature to the regular Plus account (heard on the grapevine?) or know a workaround?

It‚Äôs currently the only thing that really irritates me with Notion (love it otherwise), as it feels annoying to be paying a fair bit but not get such a standard consumer feature.",4,0.84,3,2025-08-21 07:44:05+00:00,Efficient_Archer3954,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mw4jjh/conditional_rules_in_forms_on_a_plus_account/,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mw4jjh/conditional_rules_in_forms_on_a_plus_account/,‚ùìQuestions   ,True,2025-08-25 21:33:53.423161+00:00

1mvljyd,Built a dashboard to finally make saved posts usable (instead of a black hole),"Okay, real talk. I save so much online. A Reddit thread about time-blocking. A tweet thread on building habits. A YouTube video about deep work. I tell myself ""I'll come back to this,"" hit save, and that's it. It just vanishes into the void.

I checked my saved posts the other day and found 80 plus things I'd forgotten about. All scattered across apps, zero way to search them, no way to organize. Just a messy pile of ""maybe later."" It felt less like saving and more like digital hoarding.

So I finally built something for myself to fix it. [Savvitic](https://savvitic.vercel.app/). Yeah, weird name, I know. Still working on that.

It's basically a little dashboard that pulls in all my saved stuff from Reddit, Twitter, YouTube and puts it in one place where I can actually use it.

Now I can:

\- Search everything. Finally found that one tip about inbox zero

\- Tag things like ""workflow,"" ""ideas,"" or ""watch later""

\- Add short notes to remember why I saved something

\- Get a weekly email with random old saves. Surprisingly helpful

\- Export to Notion or Obsidian when I want to go deeper

There's a pro version with AI summaries and smart tags, but the core app is free and open source.

I made it for me, but I'm curious if this is a thing other people struggle with.

Do you actually go back and use your saved posts? Or is everyone just hoarding bookmarks like I was?

If this sounds familiar, I'd love your thoughts: [https://savvitic.vercel.app/](https://savvitic.vercel.app/)

1mvhwcd,How to automatically generate weaknesses and resistances from related databases (like Pok√©mon)?,"Hi, I‚Äôm trying to set up a system in Notion for a game project. I currently have two databases:

1. **Types Database** ‚Äì Each type has its weaknesses, and resistances.
2. **Creatures Database** ‚Äì Each creature can have one or several types.

What I‚Äôd like to achieve is: whenever I open a creature‚Äôs page, I want to see a table that automatically shows its **weaknesses and resistances** based on its assigned types (like in the screenshot attached).  
In this logic, I only edit the **Types Database** to define or modify strengths, weaknesses, and resistances. The **Creatures Database** should just reflect these automatically, without me having to manually update each creature.

For example (similar to the logic in Pok√©mon):

* A creature in the table should display something like :
   * Very Weak to: Type 1
   * Weak to: Type 2
   * Resistant to: Type 3
   * Very Resistant to: Type 4, Type 5

The problem I‚Äôm facing is that I get stuck with **nested rollups**. I can roll up the weaknesses and resistances of each type, but I can‚Äôt seem to combine them properly across multiple types. For example, if a creature has two types that are both weak to the same type, I‚Äôd like that to show up as a **‚Äúdouble weakness‚Äù** instead of just a normal weakness. Same issue for **double resistances**.

Is there any way to achieve this in Notion with relations/rollups, or a workaround to detect and display these combined effects?",1,1.0,2,2025-08-20 15:25:36+00:00,Sebster_Game_dev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mvhwcd/how_to_automatically_generate_weaknesses_and/,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mvhwcd/how_to_automatically_generate_weaknesses_and/,‚ùìQuestions   ,True,2025-08-25 21:33:56.503005+00:00

I live inside Notion. My projects, my resume, my reading list... everything. But I've always struggled with sharing it. Sending a raw Notion link feels a bit clunky and unprofessional, especially for job applications.

This is gonna be a long post so I apologize in advance.

I‚Äôm having an internal conflict whether should I use Apple Ecosystem (Notes/Reminders/Calendar/Numbers) or Notion. Here‚Äôs the comparison between them and this is the cause of my confusion:

Phone UI & Widgets: Apple > Notion.

Notifications (offline): Apple > Notion.

Desktop: Apple < Notion.

Small Tasks & Everyday Use: Apple = Notion.

Large Tasks, Projects & Second Brain: Apple < Notion.

My main problem is, when I‚Äôm taking notes, scheduling stuff, managing tasks on my phone, Apple Ecosystem feels better, when I‚Äôm on my desktop, Notion is extremely better.

1mv169b,How to Get Good at Building Your Notion Templates,"One of the questions I get most whenever I post my templates is how can I build something like this? or how can I get more advanced in Notion? Honestly, there‚Äôs no way to learn everything in just one day or even a few days. It‚Äôs a skill you develop little by little by time.

I always say just start, that‚Äôs exactly how I did it. I started small, databases were something I never implemented at the beginning. I played with checklists, pages, columns, and images, and tried to make everything look as aesthetic as possible. Then I started learning more by watching Notion dashboard tours or tutorials, and practicing on my own dashboard. Practice is key so practice, practice, practice and apply what you learn to your own templates. Next time you find a template you like, try to understand how it‚Äôs structured and replicate small parts in your own, never copy, but make it suitable for your own needs and style. Play with it, and make it a point to learn a new feature each time.

1mutdvi,I hate friction so much I connected Notion directly to my blog.,"Long story short, it's incredible for my brain!

There's something about Notion that makes it the perfect blog CMS for me. Now publishing a blog post looks like this:

1. Write drafts in Obsidian
2. Create a new page in my Notion ""Blog CMS"" database and paste the final markdown
3. Double check the formatting and make a few minor edits (just me?)
4. Set the sync status property to ""checked"" so Whalesync knows it's ready to publish to Webflow
5. Look at the post live on my site!

Done.

That's the entire workflow.

For my brain, everything in Notion is published and if I want to edit anything published, that's where I go.  
Everything in Obsidian is a draft and if I want to brain dump or write a rough outline, it happens there.  
It's a really clean mental separation.

BUT and this is the biggest part for me personally, when I want to edit a live blog post, which often happens (I'm more of a ""publish it and then make it better over time"" type than a ""good enough and forget about it"" type) I just open Notion, use the database search to quickly find the post, make the edits, and it's done.

If I'm doing a lot of edits, I can uncheck the checkbox in Notion to pause syncing on that post and then recheck it when I'm finished.

Now for the explanation of how and why I got here.

Focus is hard and friction often breaks mine.  
I have boxes of notebooks and hard drives of folders of almost complete but not shipped research and writing.

Productivity hacks are more entertaining than effective when you're neurologically atypical like me.

My attention shifted to curiosity about how my brain works and what works for my brain.  
One standout thing has been this: tools and environment make more of an impact than goals.  
How doing the work feels is significant. More significant than the result. This is probably due to my very limited working memory. But regardless, it's true, at least for me.

So while there are a lot of tools out there that could help me work faster or automate things, they generally had a net negative impact on my overall throughput.

Because I would get the work done ""efficiently"" but then be mentally exhausted and end up following mindless and meaningless rabbit trails while attempting to reengage in the next work to be done.  
(Side note: AI is awfully good for this.)

The automations and tools were adding cognitive load. This applies both within and outside of Notion. Taxing my very limited working memory further. Creating lots of little friction points from switching tabs and windows or clicking five times to get to the next item to edit.

Notion has always almost been a great place for me to work.

The benefits being the editor UI and database with pages inside concept.

The two main problems being milliseconds of friction everywhere and the feeling that working in Notion meant working on copies of things instead of the things themselves. Just like Word and Docs before, everything still had to be copied and pasted somewhere else to be ""live"".

Recently I've been doing more of my writing in Obsidian.  
Considering a full move away from Notion.  
But separately and simultaneously looking for a CMS and website setup to handle blog publishing in a minimal, works-for-my-brain way.

No code tools and automations have been a no go for me, because something about them feels fragile and more like a quest than a problem solving tool.

As it turns out, you don't have to build a workflow with an automation tool like n8n or make to connect Notion to Webflow CMS. You can connect the actual Notion blog database to the Webflow CMS collection using Whalesync. With this setup, Notion is the CMS, Webflow the site builder/host, and Obsidian where I write my drafts.

And that is what I have done.

Now I get the instant responsiveness of Obsidian for writing.

With the formatting (simply pasting images and markdown) and fluid editing of Notion. But instead of needing to copy and paste everything out of it, I just click and un-click a single checkbox.

The weirdest part to me is that on paper, I'm still copying and pasting drafts from Obsidian into Notion, so there shouldn't be any actual gains from a productivity point of view, and yet it FEELS completely different. Maybe it's because Notion is an easy to access, nicely formatted place to paste into?

Now I'm looking for other non-obvious anti-patterns to apply.

Do you have any to share that I could try?",2,1.0,1,2025-08-19 20:04:14+00:00,This_Conclusion9402,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mutdvi/i_hate_friction_so_much_i_connected_notion/,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mutdvi/i_hate_friction_so_much_i_connected_notion/,üß© API / Integrations,True,2025-08-25 21:33:56.503093+00:00

1mur9hu,Help with property/rollup display filtering,"Hello! I'm hoping someone can help me figure this out.

My goal is to create a property that displays entries from a related database, but only if that item meets a certain condition. 

* I have a Books database, and a Notes database. I've set up a relation going both directions, and also rollups showing the related items on each (related Notes rollup in Books, and vice versa). 
* They don't always relate 1:1, so I've created a ""select"" property within Notes for the following types: Reading Notes (highlights from a single book), and Topic Notes (where I can aggregate info from multiple books and tie them together). 
* I have a Currently Reading block, which is a filtered view of the Books database, showing books in progress. It also shows the rollup property with related Notes entries.

**What I can't figure out**: Is there a way to filter these displayed Notes entries so that *only* Reading Notes show up on this view? 

From my searching so far I understand that we can only filter *based on* rollups, but we can't filter the rollup properties themselves. I'm open to rearranging the setup if there is something else that might work. I've only just started dabbling with formulas, and I don't have coding experience, but I enjoy this kind of thing so I'm open to learning.

1mulkuu,Sync Your Bank Transactions to Notion ‚Äì Lightweight Budgeting Tool I Built!,"Hey everyone!  
I recently built a small tool that connects your bank account to Notion and automatically logs your transactions. I made it because I wanted to track my expenses better after moving abroad, and since I already use Notion for everything (tasks, finances, even memories), it felt natural to bring this there too.

The tool does a few helpful things:

* Fetches your expenses from your bank account and adds them to Notion automatically, in a smart way
* Categorizes expenses and income automatically (using both keywords and sentence transformers for semantic matching)
* Converts currencies to USD (or any currency you want) with real-time exchange rates (and falls back to cached rates when needed)
* Works across multiple accounts, not just one
* Easily integrates with any Notion database structure!

It‚Äôs built with FastAPI, uses [TrueLayer](https://truelayer.com) for secure banking access (works with most EU/UK banks), and Notion‚Äôs API to push the data. 

Categorization is done with some logic + sentence transformers, so even vague or weird descriptions still get sorted decently well. I'm trying not to bloat the project too much ‚Äî I want to keep it a simple, focused tool ‚Äî but I'm always open to suggestions or small improvements.

1mukucw,Sharing a Free Notion Template to Track Short Term Rental Occupancy & Bookings Across Platforms,"**Still managing multiple spreadsheets or paying for expensive property management softwares to track the occupancy for your short term rentals in 2025?**

https://preview.redd.it/gdzh0gtzpzjf1.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cb97facf6955486d5e6e92ae620e87cfea907e4

I built a visual Occupancy tracker on Notion that helps property hosts track the occupancy of their short term rentals in one clean dashboard - by month, property and platform.

I host a couple of short term rentals across platforms such as Airbnb, Direct Website and other platforms and keeping track of bookings, occupancy and revenue used to be a big challenge until I created this notion template.

üí°**The template tracks:**

* Guest bookings
* Check-in and Check-out dates
* Nights booked
* **Occupancy % by month, property & platform**¬†
* Revenue per night¬†
* Switch between month view, property view and platform view

This beginner friendly system is fully built in Notion. Would love any **feedback or ideas** on how I can effectively improve this template for you and other property hosts.¬†

I‚Äôm sharing this template for free. If anyone wants the link, leave a comment and I'll DM it to you or post in the comments.

I'm using this tracker as part of my complete Notion system for short term rental management. The Notion system includes customisable dashboards to manage and track guest bookings, cleaning tasks, expenses and the inventory of your properties in one centralised place. You can also view performance highlights for your properties and bookings with the help of Notions‚Äôs chart views.

Happy to share more, if you are interested.",0,0.5,0,2025-08-19 14:58:46+00:00,hostlifetools,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mukucw/sharing_a_free_notion_template_to_track_short/,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mukucw/sharing_a_free_notion_template_to_track_short/,üéÅ Free Templates,True,2025-08-25 21:33:56.503147+00:00

I've been using Notion for the past two years for both personal and work needs, from taking notes to managing tasks. I really enjoy it because it fulfills almost all my needs, even with the free plan, which I think is more than enough.

Lately, though, a question has been bothering me. As a free-plan user, can I really use Notion forever? Are there any usage limits, like the number of 'blocks', for free users? I'm worried that all my notes and tasks might become inaccessible one day.

Could you please provide some information on this?

1mufpzy,"Gamified Life OS: No fluff, no gimmicks. A way to solo level your way up in life.","Hey friends,

Just being real here:¬†**this is a paid template**¬†(appropriate flair), but one I poured a lot into and wanted to share.

Gamified Life OS is a productivity system I built because I got tired of all the ""gamified"" templates that were overly complicated, cluttered, and full of try-hard widgets. They felt like a chore to maintain.

I wanted something that made life¬†*feel*¬†like a game‚Äîbut a game that‚Äôs worth playing. No gimmicks. No fake rewards. Just a clean, motivating system that helps you actually move forward. Visual feedback.

* **Action-first design**¬†‚Äì Tasks, habits, and activities are laid out to push you to act, not overthink.
* **Gamified Progression**¬†‚Äì Track EXP across your life areas, level up, and unlock real-world rewards like 4K wallpapers, and premium Notion templates
* **Themes & Customization**¬†‚Äì Minimalist? Fantasy? Cyberpunk? Ghibli? Pick your vibe. Tweak it however you want. No rigid layouts.
* **Dashboard Builder**¬†‚Äì Add/remove whatever you need. This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù thing. You can use as little or as many features as you want. You are not FORCED to use every single feature and maintain it.
* **No bloat**¬†‚Äì No spinning clocks or fake widgets. Just a lean, functional setup that doesn‚Äôt waste your time. Even the aesthetic images serve as a visual breaks to help guide your eyes to the actionable elements.

It‚Äôs inspired by¬†**Avatar: The Last**¬†**Airbender**. I built it around mastering 4 Life Elements:¬†**Body, Mind, Spirit, and Harmony**. As you grow in these, you level up your ‚ÄúAvatar.‚Äù Simple. Motivating. Fun.

When I first released Gamified Life OS, it really blew up, getting featured by the official Notion team and eventually¬†[**gaining 100k views on TikTok**](https://www.tiktok.com/@rebecca_drawsgood/video/7429441163410558224), and now has over 1,000 customers and 5 stars on Gumroad.

I maintain a¬†**Total Satisfaction Policy**, meaning you will get unlimited customer service addressing¬†**all**¬†your concerns until you feel satisfied.

1mue6st,"Roast my idea: Solution which easily adds any resource to Notion DB from scrolling? (YT videos, tweets, images, urls)","Hey everyone,

As a solopreneur with extensive experience in Notion and full-stack development, I‚Äôve turned a common problem into a practical solution.

Problem:

‚Ä¢  Endless scrolling through inspiring tweets, videos,   URLs, posts, and more.
‚Ä¢  Wasted time, and valuable knowledge quickly forgotten.

Solution:

‚Ä¢  A system that lets you copy the URL of a post, tweet, video, or anything else, and saves it in a convenient way for future processing.

Scope of the solution:

‚Ä¢  Users scroll through Twitter, YouTube videos, LinkedIn, Instagram, websites, etc.
‚Ä¢  They encounter inspiring content.
‚Ä¢  The user copies the URL, takes a screenshot, or similar.
‚Ä¢  They run a shortcut on iOS (e.g., double-tap on the back of the phone for convenience) or pass the URL via Telegram.
‚Ä¢  The solution processes the URL: extracts tweet content and author, gets YouTube transcriptions, scrapes websites, etc.
‚Ä¢  It saves the extracted content in Notion and categorizes it automatically.
Potential additional features:
‚Ä¢  Interact with your saved resources via Telegram, an app, or another interface using AI.
‚Ä¢  Generate reports or excerpts of what you found interesting, and more.

I‚Äôve already worked out the logic for this solution, and I‚Äôll finish a beta version this week.

Anyone interested in testing? 
Please DM me or leave a comment, and I‚Äôll reach out. I‚Äôll probably launch a waitlist today.

If you have any insights or suggestions, I‚Äôd love to hear them!

Any suggestions for how to actually get attention from Notion?

**The core issue:** Deep links to toggle content work inconsistently or fail completely across different browsers/conditions:

* ‚úÖ Work when signed into Notion
* ‚ùå Fail for users not signed into Notion (aka 99% of my customers)
* ‚ùå Broken on Android Chrome (\~1/3 of users)
* ‚ùå Get ""stuck"" on wrong sections when multiple toggles are open

**Why this matters:** We built our entire company FAQ system in Notion with thousands of users depending on it. I specifically chose Notion FOR the deep linking capability. Now I'm constantly telling customers ""sorry, Notion has bugs, the links might not work.""

**Support experience:** after 9 months it's just ""engineering is still working on it"" with zero concrete timeline. They've acknowledged it's not a widespread issue but affects specific conditions - which happen to be exactly how external users access our content.

**Has anyone else experienced this?** Specifically:

* Deep links failing for non-Notion users
* Inconsistent behavior across browsers/devices
* Toggle links not opening/scrolling correctly

I'm seriously considering migrating our entire knowledge base off Notion. For an Enterprise customer paying premium prices, this level of broken core functionality is unacceptable.

Here are two specific examples that work when signed into Notion, but not when not signed in:

1mtsy5a,"Notion Mail ""Member"" Pricing for Multiple Inboxes?","After returning to Notion and signing up for the Business plan, I‚Äôve been stuck in a support loop over what I thought was a basic use case: **using Notion Mail‚Äôs AI features across multiple email inboxes that I personally manage.**

Here‚Äôs my setup:

* I have several roles across a couple businesses, each with its own email inbox (think: [myname@biz1.com](mailto:myname@biz1.com), [myname@biz2.com](mailto:myname@biz2.com), etc.)

* I have *one* Notion workspace, tied to a single primary email.
* All I want: to use Notion Mail‚Äôs AI features (which I‚Äôm already paying for) across all my inboxes. I don‚Äôt care about a unified inbox or seeing all my mail in one place‚ÄîI just want the AI tools available on all my accounts.

**Notion‚Äôs solution:**

Every inbox you want to use with AI has to be added as a ‚Äúmember‚Äù to your workspace. In Notion-speak, ‚Äúmember‚Äù = ‚Äúperson.‚Äù So for me to use AI in all my inboxes, I‚Äôd need to pay for *each* as a full membership. That‚Äôs an **extra** $72/month, just so inboxes I personally manage can all use the AI features.

When I tried to clarify this with support (multiple times), they kept telling me how to add accounts or warning me that ‚Äúunified inbox‚Äù isn‚Äôt available (which I never asked for).

* Why is every inbox treated like a separate employee? Who thought that made sense for anyone managing multiple businesses or roles?

* How is this pricing structure even remotely competitive with other premium email tools?
* Why is it so hard to get a straight answer from support about a basic business workflow?

Honestly, the whole experience has been so confusing and tone-deaf that I‚Äôm rethinking my commitment to Notion. Has anyone else run into this? Has anyone found a workaround or a plan that doesn‚Äôt treat every inbox as a unique human?

I would be thrilled to hear if I'm misunderstanding something here.

I'm trying to challenge my way through cuz Ik for a fact that once I figure it out it will actually help me study better cuz I'm lazy asf, and this will motivate me to study. 

Basically, I have a page where I write down the subjects, and when I click on the subjects, it takes me to a different page where I have separate specific tasks that I have to complete. For eg..projects, notebook etc... In those I have a to-do list specific to my projects or other things.

Now the thing is, I want to write my pending work on the main page and tick it off but I don't want to go through a hassle where I have to tick off everything in different pages..  

Like this -

(Main page)
‚óè Hindi           

(different page) Hindi
   ‚ñ† pg no. 1-10
   ‚ñ† chp 5
   ‚ñ† topic 7

1mtmbyi,Notion Automated Finance Tracker - Launching üöÄ¬†in 5 days,"https://preview.redd.it/zyorxr3q6sjf1.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=4293b7d9fafe4101f7292e1bdfe8fc4786dfee17

Almost a year ago, I asked for help in a few subreddits to find the perfect app for managing finances. I had been searching for the ideal solution for years.

A short introduction of me: I work as senior designer for a design agency in Philadelphia (USA) and as a freelancer. In my free time, I love organizing my life to improve my productivity (and that‚Äôs why I love Notion).

Back then, I searched for a budgeting app that checked all these boxes:

1. **‚Å†‚Å†Beautiful Design:** A sleek, modern, and user-friendly interface is essential to me. I want something that feels enjoyable to use every day.
2. **‚Å†Bank Integration**: It should connect with European banks (via Plaid or similar services). While this is a major advantage, I'm also fine with manual input if the app offers excellent features.
3. **‚Å†Widgets for Quick Entries**: I'd love widgets that simplify adding transactions, ideally with receipt scanning capabilities!
4. **‚Å†AI Features**: Automatic expense categorization (and other smart features) would be fantastic for saving time and maintaining organization.

Sadly, my search didn‚Äôt yield the result I was aiming at, so I finally decided to build my own system on Notion ‚Äîit allows you to create what fits best your needs.

These features were just the starting points for my product goals. I began to brainstorm the best Notion templates available and analyze the top financial apps like YNAB, Albert, Spendee, Mint, Monarch, Copilot, and classic Excel sheets. I evaluated the pros and cons of each product, looking for ways to improve existing features or add missing ones.

https://preview.redd.it/wcfi1a5u6sjf1.png?width=4022&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7fcdb5a722ea38a594e6602ea89974ddc9f9071

**KEY FEATURES:**

**Good Design:** As a designer, I couldn't overlook the aspect‚Äîclear and minimal interface with careful attention to detail and user experience.

**Bank Integration:** You'll receive a guide to connect all your banks to your system using Plaid, one of the safest connection methods available.

**Widget for quick entries:** Two iOS shortcuts will be available‚Äîone for scanning receipts to automatically add and categorize transactions using AI (capturing transaction name, date, amount, and more), and another for those who prefer adding transactions manually but quickly.

Here a spoiler of the most requested feature:

* Notes app / Google Keep
* Browser bookmarks
* My half-baked Notion system

Notes works, but it gets messy fast. Notion is powerful but heavy. Pocket only handles links. None of them really solve the ‚Äúsave quickly, retrieve easily‚Äù problem for me.

I was wondering:

* Do you also feel this pain of scattered saves?
* How do you personally keep your saved content organized?
* Do you think this is a ‚Äúbig enough‚Äù problem, or just something we live with?

(Not pitching anything just curious if it‚Äôs only me who finds this workflow frustrating)

After years of bouncing between tools, I wanted one workspace that *thinks* like a learner. So I built **Lingua Catalyst Pro** ‚Äî my all-in-one English learning hub in Notion.

**The Problem:**

* I kept losing track of what to review and when.
* Notes and vocab were scattered across apps.
* No tool balanced input (reading/listening) and output (speaking/writing).

**The Build:**

* **Brainstorming**: I used a custom GPT to map workflows and simulate user scenarios.
* **Problem-Solving**: Claude helped debug complex Notion formulas for spaced repetition and auto-scheduling.
* **UX Iteration**: Tested mobile widgets, pop-up reviews, and energy-based task views.

**The Result:**

* Instant vocab capture (mobile widget)
* Auto study time tracking + visual progress
* Balanced input/output tracking with active recall
* ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Tasks‚Äù view without manual planning

**Lessons Learned:**

* AI works best as a *collaborator*, not just a Q&A tool.

1mt3x2e,The Most Advanced Habit Tracker (Free),"As someone with ADHD, tracking habits is extremely important for me. I've tried many habit trackers, but most of them are either too basic or so complex that you have to write code just to add a new habit.

That‚Äôs why I built this tracker - it may look advanced, but it requires zero setup. Just create a new habit, and you‚Äôre good to go. No coding required.

It includes:

A streak tracker  
A GitHub-style heatmap to visualize your daily activity  
A clean weekly view  
Weekly Habit Goals  
Monthly Habit Goals  
Day-Based Scheduling  
Sunday As First Day Of The Week  
An orbit tracker that shows pending habits  
Time progress indicators for week, month, and year  
Optimized Mobile view

And it's completely free (you can tip though)!

1mt0euy,"We recently ""tweaked"" a shared template in Notion and broke half of our workspace - how do you prevent template drift?","We use a **Content Brief**  template across a handful of databases.  Last week, we changed the name of a property, added a relation, and archived a property we thought wasn't in use.  Minor changes, which broke a number of filters, caused some pages to lose their links, and had different people creating pages from different versions.  
  
The frustrating part is that we can't easily tell which pages are aligned with the current template.  There's no straight ‚Äúdiff‚Äù to see what has changed, and if we want to roll back changes, it would have to be done by manually undoing all of the changes.  We also don't have a safe process for experimenting with changes by a pilot before rolling them out.  
  
How are your teams solving this problem?  Do you manage versions of templates in some way, or stages of the changes?  Is there a way for you to audit other pages for ‚Äúconformance‚Äù to the latest template?

1mt0eru,Need Help with Automations Inside of Thomas Frank's Ultimate Brain 3.0 Templates,"I‚Äôm a Seattle based physician that has a full blown ‚Äúabsent minded professor‚Äù syndrome. I struggle to remember post visit admin stuff and am hoping a solution I‚Äôve brainstormed is possible with UB + automations either in Notion or something like Zapier/Make/PipeDream/etc.  
  
My appointments are put on my Google Calendar in a HIPAA compliant manner using a ID label that doesn‚Äôt mean anything on its own but plugs into the EMR to reveal who/what it is. This is done through the EMR API syncing with my Google Calendar. Is there a known way to trigger a creation of a series of several tasks within Notion, particularly inside UB? If so, is there a way they are associated with the calendar event?  
  
For example, Susan gets scheduled to see me for a follow up Monday at 10am. My Google Calendar shows ‚ÄúAppointment with PAT0123 | Video Consult | Telehealth Follow up‚Äù. I want this to trigger the creation of tasks such as ‚Äúsign orders, close chart note, send AVS, approve CPTs, approve invoice, etc‚Äù These aren‚Äôt always done the same day of the visit depending on the nature of the case and my schedule causing them to often slip through the cracks b/c the EMR has a horribly outdated reporting system that doesn‚Äôt have a way to audit for outstanding ones.

**Story**: I'm a Notion fan myself. Had a chat with Fuzzy (Notion's CTO) to help build self-organizing notes in Notion, turns out it‚Äôs not a priority for them rn.

**Motivation**: To avoid the organizational overhead (e.g., what page to use, where to place something), I often just texted my notes/logs to myself. However, this made it difficult to find/use the information later.

**Idea**: A simple text box, and a single endless page (like a chat). You can throw any information into it, and the app will make sense of it, so you can find and use it later.

**Offline and Open-Source**: Because I wouldn't trust my work logs in anyone else's hands.

It's also extremely minimal on the surface. But when required, it has powerful features built in.

1ms4bd7,Turned my Notion into an intelligent content transformation hub - here's how,"I've been struggling with something way beyond basic translation: transforming content formats while adapting for different audiences and platforms. Sure, Google Translate can convert text, but what about turning academic papers into podcast scripts, or transforming technical documentation into marketing copy? That's where things get interesting.

Recently discovered this game-changing workflow using Skywork (a multilingual LLM with strong content transformation capabilities) combined with Notion API and Python scripts. The setup reads my research database pages and intelligently transforms content - for example, turning a dense English research paper into a conversational Chinese podcast outline, complete with cultural references and simplified explanations. It maintains all the Notion formatting, tags, and relationships while completely reimagining the content for the target format and audience. What used to require hiring different writers for different markets now happens automatically in about 5 minutes per piece.

The whole automation has been a lifesaver for my content strategy across different platforms and languages. I'm curious - what's your biggest challenge with content adaptation in Notion? Are you manually rewriting everything for different audiences, or have you found creative ways to automate content transformation beyond simple translation?

1mrznuj,How do you actually share or copy a document between notion accounts without getting trapped?,"Can you **ACTUALLY** share a document between notion accounts **without paying money**...:) ?

So, easy way to share a document I know would be to simply click "" share "" on any page. But what that does  is create a shared workspace, which then puts you on a countdown timer to pay Notion within 30 days for a plan that allows shared workspaces. I went through hell trying to figure out how to untangle and unshare / delete my shared workspace that took days. 

This is a big gotcha for Notion, the second you share anything, it creates these shared workspaces and they try to charge you money within a set time period to unlock / use the workspace. I don't want to share a workspace, I just want to share the contents of 1 document that's on one account with another account. 

You would think this might be simpler but, you can't even highlight all the text in a Notion document or click CTRL+A , CTRL+C to get everything since it's divided into cells and you can't seem to copy everything. 

So, excuse the rambling but my question, IS there a way to share or copy the contents of a document between notion accounts WITHOUT ENDING UP IN A SUBSCRIPTION or in a situation where you are paying money to ultimately share the contents of a document?

I want to record time against a project. I want to record invoices against projects and whether they are paid or outstanding. I want to record meetings against contacts, companies or projects. I also want a table of the services i offer and a table of template documents and workflows. What is the most effective entity relationship structure and what fields per database do you recommend? what tips do you have?*

The agent then returned a full reply outlining the tables, fields, relationships and suggestions on how to optimise. I simply told it to build that for me in my Notion space.

I created a new/blank notion instance using a new email and when prompted by the agent; took control of the agent operator session to login.

I then sat back and watched and waited..

It finished the foundational database setup. I now have it creating views and dashboards for me.

1mrhfb7,"Free Automated Book Tracker - Books, Series, & Genres Databases","Using just the ISBN, my book tracker scrapes information from Google Books API and Goodreads on the book, series, and top genres. I've made some significant changes to my template and API, including:

* Checks for Kindle Unlimited by parsing through the first 50 Goodreads tags
* Fixed the relation between the Books and Series databases
* Added an automated Genres database
* Asks users a question about which book status they are updating (ie Not started, In progress)

I believe this could be really helpful for readers because of the Goodreads data, which includes:

1. Average rating & Number of ratings
2. Series name & Number in series
3. First four most tagged genres
4. Image link for cover
5. (Additional) Automatic Goodreads & Amazon links

1mr7z4n,Is it possible to have one-way access on embedded pages in published sites?,"Hi! Curious if a certain organization and sharing system is possible. I have a work around if not, but it would be wonderful if this worked:

I'm setting up an info site for an event, I have 1 main page, 'Staff', and some sub pages, 'Public'.

I want 'Public' to be linked into the 'Staff' page for 2 reasons: easy of use for staff to navigate between all the pages, and keeping my sidebar clean by nesting all the subpages into the 'Staff' dropdown.

However, I'd like to be able to share 'Public' with groups of people who are not staff, and I don't want them to be able to use breadcrumbs to get back to the 'Staff' page. 

I currently have the free plan of Notion because except for this specific use case, it's all I need. 

My current work around is to have all pages published separately, however this makes it hard for staff to navigate, as they can get to the 'Public' pages, but then the breadcrumbs disappear and they have to use the 'back' button to go back to 'Staff' (there are sub pages within the Public pages, so they may have to hit back multiple times which feels annoying) It also means my sidebar is so cluttered, even using team spaces.

My question is: is it possible to have a system where if you are coming from 'Staff', you can move freely between all pages, but if you start at any 'Public' page, you can't make it back to 'Staff'?

It was my first Notion template, back when Notion was just starting to go mainstream.

If you want to try it, it‚Äôs under $5 (üå±)

1mqy5pk,Outlook Email Template,"Hi,

I'm looking to set up a something of a platform to track demos with clients.

I've some experience with Notion in past and so I'm gravitating towards it. My question being, is it possible to add a button to a database/ task that would then open up, or send, a templated email from Outlook? Ideally the template would pull from from the appropriate fields from Notion, but it's not a deal-breaker if that can't be achieved.

I've looked into third party automations, but I'd like to cover off whether or not Notion could facilitate natively.

1mqwmee,MCP API should only have access to directories you select,"I have connected Claude and Notion through use of the MCP connection. As a test I wanted to limit the access to one page only. You can limit access of an integration through the website, both in terms of rights (reading, writing, access of user information, etc.) and pages. 

When I tested the access of Claude, it could access ALL my pages. I wanted to restrict access only to reading. But it has also writing rights.

When I contacted Notion support about this, they told me that it is by design that the integration has access to all pages. And that maybe in the future, they will implement the restriction to certain pages.  
They say that restricting access has negative effects on performance of the connection. 

The website only gives you the idea that you can limit access, but that is not the case. I think full rights and full access is very dangerous. For the time being, I have disconnected the Claude integration.

How do you guys think about this? And is there something I could do to safely connect Claude and Notion?

I recently landed a role in **healthcare consulting** and, going through the application process, I realised how messy it can get with juggling applications, networking, case prep, and company research all at once.

Now that I have a bit of breathing room before starting, I‚Äôm thinking of building a **Notion dashboard** to make the process way more structured for others going through the same grind.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve sketched so far:

* **Application Tracker** ‚Üí Kanban view with stages like ‚ÄúCase/Technical Interview‚Äù
* **Networking CRM** ‚Üí Track recruiters, alumni, and follow-ups
* **Interview Prep Hub** ‚Üí Sector-specific case frameworks, STAR templates, practice logs
* **Company & Industry Research DB** ‚Üí Profiles with service lines, recent projects, and industry trends
* **Analytics Dashboard** ‚Üí Conversion rates, outreach-to-interview ratio

Possible extras:

* Preloaded healthcare & consulting case prompts
* Industry acronym glossary
* Matching CV templates

A lot of similar premium Notion ‚Äúcareer OS‚Äù setups go for **$40‚Äì$70** ‚Äî but I‚Äôd like to make this much more affordable.  
Before I start building, I‚Äôd love your input:

1. What‚Äôs missing that would make this *essential* for you?
2. Which features would you actually use regularly?
3. Any pain points you‚Äôve had job hunting in these industries?
4. If you were to buy this as a complete package, what would you consider a **fair price**?

If there‚Äôs interest, I can make a **free beta version** for testers and iterate based on feedback.

2. The 2nd item below is a multi page template I found/tweaked for animated series. How to save the whole nested structure as a template?

1mqbkj8,Looking for a Practical Notion Template for Calisthenics Tracking,"Hey everyone,

For years, I‚Äôve tracked my calisthenics workouts in Excel: I‚Äôd print out my routines, bring them to the park, and jot down my performance by hand. It worked, but someone recently suggested I switch to Notion to keep everything digital and on my phone.

I gave it a try, looked up a bunch of templates, and even tried building a dashboard myself‚Ä¶ but after hours of tweaking and countless chatGPT calls, I gave up. Most templates I found feel too bloated ‚Äî packed with calorie counters, embedded YouTube tutorials, or fitness fluff that‚Äôs just not useful when you‚Äôre in the middle of a workout.

What I‚Äôm looking for is something¬†**simple, functional, and made for people who actually train**. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd love to have in a Notion setup:

* ¬†**Mobile-friendly**¬†and easy to use while working out
* ¬†**Templates for routines**: I want to select the workout of the day and just fill in my performance for each set AND THAT'S IT
* ¬†**Default warm-up/cool-down included**¬†(I usually start with 15 min jump rope and end with crunches)
* ¬†**Goal tracking per exercise**: ideally it shows the last performance of that exercise so I know what to aim for
* ¬†**Optional long-term progress tracking**¬†(graphs, tables ‚Äî not a priority, but nice to have)

If anyone has something like this set up already, I‚Äôd love to see it. Or even just ideas on how to structure it better than I‚Äôve tried so far.

I'm a new Notion - so apologies if I'm making an obvious mistake.
