1mzs1me,"A Deep Dive into the ""Spaghetti Problem"" of Complex Notion Workspaces","Hello r/Notion,

Like many of you, I use Notion as a ""second brain."" But as my system grew with dozens of interconnected databases, I realized I had accidentally created a ""spaghetti mess."" I could feel the connections through relations and rollups, but I couldn't *see* the architecture. It was a black box.

This isn't just about aesthetics; it has real consequences:

* **Onboarding is difficult:** How do you explain a complex system to a new team member?
* **Hidden Dependencies:** A small change in one database can unknowingly break a workflow somewhere else.
* **Information Silos:** Databases become ""orphaned"" and forgotten, leading to outdated knowledge.

**My Approach to a Solution: Systems Thinking**

I decided to tackle this not as a software problem, but as a *systems problem*. The goal wasn't just to plot databases on a screen, but to create a visualization that was genuinely useful and intelligent.

My philosophy was based on two principles:

1. **Intelligent Layout:** The graph shouldn't be a random cloud of nodes. I developed a custom layout engine that uses algorithms inspired by graph theory (like simulated annealing) to actively untangle the connections, minimize line crossings, and reveal the underlying structure.
2. **Connection Analysis:** Not all relations are equal. The system also needed to analyze the *strength* of connections to identify which databases are true ""hubs"" in the workspace and which are merely satellites.

Here is a look at the dashboard I've been building based on these principles.

As you can see, the goal is to provide a clean overview of the system's architecture. But a static map isn't enough. The tool is interactive and built for deep analysis. For example, you can:

* **Search and Filter:** Instantly find specific databases by name or property, allowing you to focus only on the parts of the system you need to see.
* **Isolate ""Orphaned"" Databases:** A key feature is the ability to quickly identify and isolate databases that are not being interconnected, helping you find valuable knowledge that has lost its connection to your system.
* **Export Your Architecture:** Export the visual map of your workspace to different formats (like PNG or SVG) to include in documentation, presentations, or team reviews.

I'm sharing this deep dive because I'd love to get feedback from other power users on this *approach* to solving the problem. Do these principles resonate with the issues you face?",14,0.77,7,2025-08-25 14:30:24+00:00,One-Engine-1287,https://i.redd.it/oloqj2vkb6lf1.png,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mzs1me/a_deep_dive_into_the_spaghetti_problem_of_complex/,üß© API / Integrations,False,2025-08-25 23:56:26.194366+00:00

1mzmpnp,Automate project status updates based on related tasks statuses with Notion Automations,"I've made a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4zPcBVjLhQ) on setting up a Notion automation that automatically updates the status of a project based on the status of its related tasks.

It's not the most straightforward process, as you have to define a variable as part of the automation in order to be able to precisely target the right project within the edit property action.

This automation setup and logic can be applied to many different use cases and database setups, so getting the hang of it once is really going to be worth it.

1mzoaq6,5 Years with Notion: An Honest Take - but perhaps I am using my Notion PARA setup wrong.,"# Been using Notion for 5 years now and I'm stuck in the same frustrating cycle. Maybe others can relate?

**The endless loop:**

1. Spend hours/days tweaking Notion to fit my workflow perfectly
2. Use it enthusiastically for a few weeks/months
3. Gradually stop engaging with the complex setup
4. End up just using it as a glorified knowledge database
5. Get fed up and start over with a new setup
6. Repeat infinitely

**My biggest gripes:**

Notion is simultaneously too powerful and too finicky. The customization options are overwhelming, but more importantly, things constantly break or don't show up because I missed some obscure filter setting or database property. I'll be looking for a note I KNOW exists, only to discover it's hidden because of some view configuration I forgot about.

It *could* be perfect, but it's not. The gap between potential and reality is maddening.

**What I actually want (and what's inevitable):**

A truly intelligent, zero-setup productivity system. Something that:

* Automatically summarizes my meetings and schedules follow-ups
* Reminds me of tasks based on context from my emails/messages
* Tracks projects without me having to build elaborate database schemas
* Just... works without constant maintenance

Right now I'm experimenting with ChatGPT Projects as a super basic version of this vision. I dump everything into it and get contextually aware responses based on my evolving knowledge base. No setup, no maintenance, just intelligence.

**The bottom line:** I'm done with apps that require me to become a database administrator just to track my life. The technology exists for something better - we just need someone to build it.

1mz2z1n,Notion really needs a ‚ÄúUser Mode‚Äù (separate from Edit Mode),"Hey Notion community,

I wanted to share a feature idea that I think could make Notion vastly more usable for everyday workflows. The problem is: **there is no way to separate ‚Äúcreator mode‚Äù from ‚Äúuser mode.‚Äù**

Right now, everything in Notion is always editable, which is great for building, but becomes distracting when you just want to use your tables, databases, or dashboards. Every interaction invites you to tweak properties, formulas, and layouts. For people trying to focus, this constant temptation can make task management stressful or inefficient.

The solution is simple but powerful: **Notion should have a ‚ÄúUser Mode‚Äù or ‚ÄúInteraction Mode.‚Äù**

Here‚Äôs what it could look like:

* Enter **Edit/Creator Mode** to configure databases, properties, formulas, views, and automations.
* Exit Creator Mode to simplify the interface: only elements you want interactive remain so (checkboxes, buttons, links, etc.). All other editing controls stay hidden unless you switch back.
* Users decide which parts of their setup stay interactive and which are locked.

This would effectively turn complex Notion setups into clean, usable apps for daily work, while keeping all the customization power intact. It‚Äôs like giving creators and users two separate experiences in the same workspace.

No other tool currently combines:

* Deep customization and flexibility
* Clean, distraction-free interaction
* The ability to selectively lock or hide editing controls

If implemented, this could make Notion **the ultimate productivity tool** for personal and team use. I hope the Notion team considers this‚Äîhaving a ‚ÄúUser Mode‚Äù would be a game-changer.

1n03ghn,Can I use Notion AI to summarize notes from Google Drive/Onedrive?,"I'm trying to set up a Notion workspace ahead of the new school year, and I'm reaaally confused. On Notion's webpage introducing it's features to students, it said that you could use Notion AI to summarize your class notes or get help with exam prep based on them, etc. Does this only work if I create and keep my notes inside Notion? I mostly use Google Docs or OneNote for lecture notes, papers, etc and would like to continue doing so, but connecting outside docs to Notion seems super complicated.

Tried stuff like links and embeds from Google Drive, but it seems to me that the only thing that supports this use case is the Google Drive ""connection"" which is only available for Business/Enterprise plan users?

1mz415i,Everyone has messy Notion workspaces :(,"I got tired of being lost in my own Notion workspace. Made something to fix it. Looking for 5 beta testers

Hey r/Notion,

I've lurked here for months and see the same pain everywhere: 

We build amazing systems in Notion, then can't figure out what we actually built.

The breaking point? I spent 3 hours last weekend trying to trace why deleting one rollup would break my entire finance tracker.

We need more than database views and filters. We need to see the big picture, 

how everything connects, what depends on what, where our data actually flows.

So I built something: :)

a tool that scans your workspace and shows you the complete map of your database relationships.

Here's what it found in my ""simple"" setup:

- 14+ databases I forgot I had
- Rollup chains 4 levels deep  
- Formula dependencies I never realized existed

The graph shows clusters of related databases. Click any node to see what it connects to. 

Finally understand the monster you created.

Now I'm looking for 5 people from this community to test it out and give feedback.

 Especially interested in:

- Complex workspace owners (50 +  databases)
- People who use lots of rollups/formulas
- Anyone who's ever been scared to delete something

----> Drop a comment if you're interested. Will DM the first few people.

 trying to build a solution :)

First of all please don't be rush on me. I am new at this kind of things, and I don't know how to promote my hard worked product well since I don't have a good social media account as well. You don't have to buy to support me, your constructive feedback or any recommendation will be as valuable, and will be appreciated.

So, I am here to give it a shot and promote you the habit tracker I created in about a week, without copying anyone's work or AI's work (except for the formula and script). Here are the features I placed in my habit tracker:
________
For Google Sheets --> So you need only a Google account. Compatible with all devices and operation systems. NOT FOR NOTION!

Smart setup --> just enter your month, year, age, and gender. The calendar auto-adjusts to the right number of days, highlights today and show the day names as a real calendar.
Sleep & hydration goals are auto-calculated using WHO recommendations according to your age and gender. I believe it is a unique feature.

Define up to 30 habits --> each with custom goals & 11 categories to choose from.

Category tracking --> you can track the progress of the categories in addition to the habits with progress bars and donut pie. I didn't see other trackers do it like that so far. 

Instant progress tracking --> daily check-ins with color-coded bars for habits as well as for days. Auto percentages & progress bars update as you go. They also adapt to your goal and number of habits.

Gamified medals system --> earn bronze, silver, gold medals for each habit and also for each day. Daily medals check your consistency consistency based on how many habits you completed in a day.

Sleep & Hydration Tracker --> auto-goals based on your age & gender. Color-coded daily entries + monthly line graph for trends.

One-click PDF export --> have monthly reports automatically with the right month/year in the filename.

Easy reset button --> cears all checkboxes with a safety check, so you don't accidentally clear your progress.

Everything in one tab --> people promote as more than is better, but I think it is the reverse for simplification. No need to click around multiple sheets in my tracker.

Reusable forever --> just change the month/year, reset, and you‚Äôre ready to go again. 
________

Alright this what I have for you. I believe it has some unique features that other habit trackers don't have like easy cleaning, printing to PDF, auto wellness goals and category tracking instead of only habits. I might be wrong but this is what I saw so far. Gamification is also not very common, and I think it makes it more fun to develop habit or routines üòÄ

It connects to your Notion account on first launch.  After you're connected, add a widget to your home-screen and it will ask which database you want to show.

Curious if someone can offer their expertise on this. 

I'm creating a Notion page that I want to use to track my radio program. What I have so far is a database that holds entries for specific days (Monday's show, etc) that sets the daily date automatically. Then inside I'd like to have two columns, on where I can grab a page with a prepped break filled with information, and then move it over to the other side and drop it into a filtered linked view of the same database and it categorizes itself based off of the hour (say 6am) and the time during that hour/break number (break 1, break 2, etc). I have a system that works pretty good, but if I want to put the same break in say 6am - Break 1, as well as 7am - Break 3 I can't seem to find a way to do that without it messing up all the filters. I've tried having the ""break numbers"" in a multi select, but that doesn't seem to work.

1mz1lj2,How can I set up a Discord bot to show upcoming assignments from my Notion database with commands like !assignments upcoming,"Hi everyone, I have a database in Notion where I track all my assignments. I also use Discord a lot for communication.

I heard that I can connect Notion and Discord using tools like Zapier, but I‚Äôm not sure if Zapier supports interactive commands like this. Do I need a custom-coded Discord bot to achieve this, or is there a no-code way to do it? Also, does this kind of integration require paid services?

1mz2znv,Do we underestimate how far Notion can go when pushed to its limits?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been obsessed with pushing Notion beyond what it was designed for. Over the past months I poured more than 900 hours into building a system that doesn‚Äôt feel like a template anymore ‚Äì more like a complete operating system for life and work.

It‚Äôs fully modular, has 4 core hubs (Focus, Health, Finance, Growth), 20+ embedded AI prompts, and more than 1,500 curated visuals to make it actually feel like a designed product. I wanted it to have the clarity and elegance of something you‚Äôd expect from an Apple launch, but inside Notion.

The result is a space where everything connects: projects, habits, meals, workouts, finances, networks, even travel. It‚Äôs not about stacking databases, it‚Äôs about having one consistent architecture where life just makes sense.

I‚Äôm super curious what you all think:
‚Äì Has anyone else here tried to build something that ambitious in Notion?
‚Äì Do you think there‚Äôs a future where Notion becomes more of a platform for full ecosystems rather than just templates?

I feel like there is an easy fix to this i‚Äôm not seeing? ,1,1.0,1,2025-08-24 05:40:50+00:00,JaNz101cool,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mynhfw/notion_calendar_not_showing_on_my_notion/,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mynhfw/notion_calendar_not_showing_on_my_notion/,‚ùìQuestions   ,True,2025-08-25 23:56:26.194453+00:00
1my6o8h,Lost all Data,"I really need help on this one. I recently just updated to the latest notion version (as of this post). I created a new workspace within the same account where the workspace has everything you‚Äôd see upon starting a new notion account.

But upon navigating my notion, I realised I didn‚Äôt need another workspace and deleted the new workspace I created. Shortly afterwards, I logged out of my account on google chrome from my mac to log in via the desktop version.

On my notion desktop, I logged in with said account and suddenly everything was lost. I lost information on my university notes and assignments, class schedules, deadlines, and other personal management systems.

But what became the nail in the coffin for me was how I am also using notion to manage my club as a president. Now I‚Äôve lost my club‚Äôs operations database, membership details, fund allocations, Terms of Reference that I have been working on my whole semester break with my committee members.

I don‚Äôt know what to think, say, or do at the moment because this made me feel so bad. Especially when I also run my small business doing art commissions where I track everything on the app.

I have emailed Notion about my issue and have requested a ticket from their website. I hope I can  update you guys further with good news. As of now I can only vent. 

Speaking of my club, Semester is starting in like a week from now and I drafted all my necessary documents on notion for me to publish and send to the university department for review. I can‚Äôt believe this is happening to me at this time since I‚Äôve been using this app since 2020 during covid in secondary school.

1myenr6,I'm creating a Notion template to help me plan Commander Deck builds; struggling to figure out certain features. Any guidance is appreciated.,"I would like to be able to add a card as a to-do block to a category, in this case ""Lands"". I would like the value X in the category title (Lands X/Y/40) to update +1 when that block is added. When checked, I would like the Y value to update +1 as well. Also, I would like the card name to populate in its category on the ""Deck List"" table when checked, and get removed when unchecked. Since I'm not expecting anyone to have to spell this out for me, what concepts do I need to learn to make this happen, if possible? Any keywords or topics would be helpful for me. Also, I'm pretty new to MTG and Commander Decks so if my classification of card types in this template is suboptimal I'm also open to suggestions there.",2,1.0,4,2025-08-23 22:13:17+00:00,alexno_x,https://i.redd.it/wmn9r99seukf1.png,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1myenr6/im_creating_a_notion_template_to_help_me_plan/,‚ùìQuestions   ,False,2025-08-25 23:56:26.194457+00:00
1myi9y7,Can‚Äôt get Notion Mail to connect‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôve been trying to set this up for some time with no luck. Turning to Reddit before giving up. Have a free Notion account to try it out (been using Obsidian and Anytime to find the right solution as well), and I wanted to check out the Notion Mail app. Every time I try to connect my Gmail, it fails. It will get to the point of entering my Gmail credentials and it will even show where I have already given permission for Notion to access my Gmail but then the next screen says ‚ÄúGmail setup failed. Please try connecting again.‚Äù  Tried signing out of and deleting all apps and reinstalling but same outcome. My email I‚Äôm trying to setup is the same address my account is tied to. 

Needless to say, I‚Äôve wasted more time on it then I have spent trying to test drove Notion, but starting to think this might be a sign from the Productivity Gods‚Ä¶ lol

1myhtjt,Creating spreadsheet for production management,"I‚Äôm researching options for a database and wondering if Notion is the right option for me. 
Note, computers are not my forte - for context, before moving into my current work role using Excel / Google sheets four years ago, my previous spreadsheet encounters were with Windows 95. ü§™
I‚Äôve learned and relearned a lot, YouTube and Google have been my best friends. üòÇ
I don‚Äôt know the lingo or how to explain this any better, so I apologise for the lengthy explanation and question!

My job is to manage the workflow for the production of custom made jewellery. I manage around 150 jobs at any given time. 
I‚Äôm using Google sheets with the following fields: client, designer, due date, current stage, stage due, next stage, and two additional columns to note the date a procedure has been outsourced or a part ordered and to / from whom. 
Each client has a row, so the spreadsheet is approx 150 rows long. 
My issue is that I‚Äôm sure my workload has outgrown this format. I need to rely on a database giving me prompts for things being due, staying stagnant for too long, etc, rather than just reflecting where something is currently at. I‚Äôm hoping for a lot more automation to make this tracking more efficient rather than being so manual and time consuming. 

I‚Äôve done a deep dive on project management software, Gantt charts, Kanban tables and the like, but none seem quite right. 
I love the way Notion appears to work, and the fact I can integrate a dashboard with daily tasks and other things, basically creating a hub for my work overall, as well as this spreadsheet. I also love the potential for automated functions - I can see for example that Zapier can talk to my CRM to autofill some things for me. 
But can a Notion table be set up to do what I‚Äôm asking? Or am I better off just using the dashboard functionality and linking it to my Google sheet which, in turn, I could potentially learn to better automate? I‚Äôm going around in circles and on many tangents with my YouTubing trying to find the answer. I‚Äôm searching templates but can‚Äôt find anything quite right, though I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just not using the right words (project management, production management, workflow). 
I appreciate any insights!

1my6llr,Seeking help with conditional coloring for due/overdue items,"I'm currently setting up a to do list system, though I'd also like to use this for task / bug tracking. My plan is to reference the ""Due Date"" property to color lines in my table view for any due or overdue items.

The problem however is as soon as I try and do anything like ""Due date is before/after/relative to"", it switches to a Start Date / End Date selection. And either those properties are not in my database, or they are used for tracking other things already.

I also tried following the AI's advice and creating formula property that calculates the time before/after Due Date and to color by that input, but I can't reference the output of that in conditional coloring either.

Is there any way I can make this happen?",2,1.0,3,2025-08-23 16:53:31+00:00,Super-Evening8420,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1my6llr/seeking_help_with_conditional_coloring_for/,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1my6llr/seeking_help_with_conditional_coloring_for/,‚ùìQuestions   ,True,2025-08-25 23:56:26.194465+00:00
