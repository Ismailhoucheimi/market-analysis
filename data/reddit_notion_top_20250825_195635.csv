1mzmpnp,Automate project status updates based on related tasks statuses with Notion Automations,"I've made a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4zPcBVjLhQ) on setting up a Notion automation that automatically updates the status of a project based on the status of its related tasks.

It's not the most straightforward process, as you have to define a variable as part of the automation in order to be able to precisely target the right project within the edit property action.

This automation setup and logic can be applied to many different use cases and database setups, so getting the hang of it once is really going to be worth it.

I've been asked how to set this up multiple times, so I decided to make a video about it and to share it here since it might be helpful for others too.",27,0.97,1,2025-08-25 10:22:40+00:00,consistentbenny,https://i.redd.it/rno5qez765lf1.png,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mzmpnp/automate_project_status_updates_based_on_related/,Databases,False,2025-08-25 23:56:35.915726+00:00
1mzoaq6,5 Years with Notion: An Honest Take - but perhaps I am using my Notion PARA setup wrong.,"# Been using Notion for 5 years now and I'm stuck in the same frustrating cycle. Maybe others can relate?

**The endless loop:**

1. Spend hours/days tweaking Notion to fit my workflow perfectly
2. Use it enthusiastically for a few weeks/months
3. Gradually stop engaging with the complex setup
4. End up just using it as a glorified knowledge database
5. Get fed up and start over with a new setup
6. Repeat infinitely

**My biggest gripes:**

Notion is simultaneously too powerful and too finicky. The customization options are overwhelming, but more importantly, things constantly break or don't show up because I missed some obscure filter setting or database property. I'll be looking for a note I KNOW exists, only to discover it's hidden because of some view configuration I forgot about.

It *could* be perfect, but it's not. The gap between potential and reality is maddening.

**What I actually want (and what's inevitable):**

A truly intelligent, zero-setup productivity system. Something that:

* Automatically summarizes my meetings and schedules follow-ups
* Reminds me of tasks based on context from my emails/messages
* Tracks projects without me having to build elaborate database schemas
* Just... works without constant maintenance

Right now I'm experimenting with ChatGPT Projects as a super basic version of this vision. I dump everything into it and get contextually aware responses based on my evolving knowledge base. No setup, no maintenance, just intelligence.

**The bottom line:** I'm done with apps that require me to become a database administrator just to track my life. The technology exists for something better - we just need someone to build it.

Anyone else feeling this Notion fatigue? What are you using instead?",19,0.88,24,2025-08-25 11:48:55+00:00,therealhumanchaos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mzoaq6/5_years_with_notion_an_honest_take_but_perhaps_i/,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mzoaq6/5_years_with_notion_an_honest_take_but_perhaps_i/,üì¢  Discussion Topic,True,2025-08-25 23:56:35.915729+00:00
1mzs1me,"A Deep Dive into the ""Spaghetti Problem"" of Complex Notion Workspaces","Hello r/Notion,

Like many of you, I use Notion as a ""second brain."" But as my system grew with dozens of interconnected databases, I realized I had accidentally created a ""spaghetti mess."" I could feel the connections through relations and rollups, but I couldn't *see* the architecture. It was a black box.

This isn't just about aesthetics; it has real consequences:

* **Onboarding is difficult:** How do you explain a complex system to a new team member?
* **Hidden Dependencies:** A small change in one database can unknowingly break a workflow somewhere else.
* **Information Silos:** Databases become ""orphaned"" and forgotten, leading to outdated knowledge.

**My Approach to a Solution: Systems Thinking**

I decided to tackle this not as a software problem, but as a *systems problem*. The goal wasn't just to plot databases on a screen, but to create a visualization that was genuinely useful and intelligent.

My philosophy was based on two principles:

1. **Intelligent Layout:** The graph shouldn't be a random cloud of nodes. I developed a custom layout engine that uses algorithms inspired by graph theory (like simulated annealing) to actively untangle the connections, minimize line crossings, and reveal the underlying structure.
2. **Connection Analysis:** Not all relations are equal. The system also needed to analyze the *strength* of connections to identify which databases are true ""hubs"" in the workspace and which are merely satellites.

Here is a look at the dashboard I've been building based on these principles.

As you can see, the goal is to provide a clean overview of the system's architecture. But a static map isn't enough. The tool is interactive and built for deep analysis. For example, you can:

* **Search and Filter:** Instantly find specific databases by name or property, allowing you to focus only on the parts of the system you need to see.
* **Isolate ""Orphaned"" Databases:** A key feature is the ability to quickly identify and isolate databases that are not being interconnected, helping you find valuable knowledge that has lost its connection to your system.
* **Export Your Architecture:** Export the visual map of your workspace to different formats (like PNG or SVG) to include in documentation, presentations, or team reviews.

I'm sharing this deep dive because I'd love to get feedback from other power users on this *approach* to solving the problem. Do these principles resonate with the issues you face?",15,0.8,7,2025-08-25 14:30:24+00:00,One-Engine-1287,https://i.redd.it/oloqj2vkb6lf1.png,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mzs1me/a_deep_dive_into_the_spaghetti_problem_of_complex/,üß© API / Integrations,False,2025-08-25 23:56:35.915730+00:00

1n03ghn,Can I use Notion AI to summarize notes from Google Drive/Onedrive?,"I'm trying to set up a Notion workspace ahead of the new school year, and I'm reaaally confused. On Notion's webpage introducing it's features to students, it said that you could use Notion AI to summarize your class notes or get help with exam prep based on them, etc. Does this only work if I create and keep my notes inside Notion? I mostly use Google Docs or OneNote for lecture notes, papers, etc and would like to continue doing so, but connecting outside docs to Notion seems super complicated.

Tried stuff like links and embeds from Google Drive, but it seems to me that the only thing that supports this use case is the Google Drive ""connection"" which is only available for Business/Enterprise plan users?

This seems like a feature that would be extremely useful for students who's uni runs on Google Workspace and/or Microsoft 365 for example, not just companies lol.

Part-time entrepreneurs often face challenges, including:

* Scattered notes everywhere
* Forgetting important tasks
* Feeling guilty about slow progress
* Not knowing what to work on next
* Starting and stopping repeatedly



I created a Notion template to help them overcome those issues.  
  
The goal is to help them achieve:

* Centralized place for everything important
* Clear priority system (what's urgent vs. what makes money)
* Built-in mental hacks that actually work



Could you please review and give me feedback on what works well and what needs to be improved? If you are a potential customer, would you consider purchasing it? Your feedback is greatly appreciated! Thanks a lot!!

1mzsjcj,Notion AI + Google Drive,"Been using Notion for around a year now and really like it.  Finally decided to pay for it and really lean into the Notion AI and other features to see what I can get out of it.  I tried connecting it to Google Drive, which I use extensively, and was disappointed that it's not working (screenshot below).  It's just a personal google account that I pay for extra storage on.  Do I *really* have to have a Google workspace to be able to connect Notion AI?  That would be a huge disappointment, honestly.

  
Edit: the same also seems to be true for the gmail connector too?

1mzpprz,I will try to sell you my digital habit tracker!,"Hello guys,

First of all please don't be rush on me. I am new at this kind of things, and I don't know how to promote my hard worked product well since I don't have a good social media account as well. You don't have to buy to support me, your constructive feedback or any recommendation will be as valuable, and will be appreciated.

So, I am here to give it a shot and promote you the habit tracker I created in about a week, without copying anyone's work or AI's work (except for the formula and script). Here are the features I placed in my habit tracker:
________
For Google Sheets --> So you need only a Google account. Compatible with all devices and operation systems. NOT FOR NOTION!

Smart setup --> just enter your month, year, age, and gender. The calendar auto-adjusts to the right number of days, highlights today and show the day names as a real calendar.
Sleep & hydration goals are auto-calculated using WHO recommendations according to your age and gender. I believe it is a unique feature.

Define up to 30 habits --> each with custom goals & 11 categories to choose from.

Category tracking --> you can track the progress of the categories in addition to the habits with progress bars and donut pie. I didn't see other trackers do it like that so far. 

Instant progress tracking --> daily check-ins with color-coded bars for habits as well as for days. Auto percentages & progress bars update as you go. They also adapt to your goal and number of habits.

Gamified medals system --> earn bronze, silver, gold medals for each habit and also for each day. Daily medals check your consistency consistency based on how many habits you completed in a day.

Sleep & Hydration Tracker --> auto-goals based on your age & gender. Color-coded daily entries + monthly line graph for trends.

One-click PDF export --> have monthly reports automatically with the right month/year in the filename.

Easy reset button --> cears all checkboxes with a safety check, so you don't accidentally clear your progress.

Everything in one tab --> people promote as more than is better, but I think it is the reverse for simplification. No need to click around multiple sheets in my tracker.

Reusable forever --> just change the month/year, reset, and you‚Äôre ready to go again. 
________

Alright this what I have for you. I believe it has some unique features that other habit trackers don't have like easy cleaning, printing to PDF, auto wellness goals and category tracking instead of only habits. I might be wrong but this is what I saw so far. Gamification is also not very common, and I think it makes it more fun to develop habit or routines üòÄ

I sell it with 50% discount on Etsy now as a kick off. (Anywhere else as a recommendation?) Don't be scared when you see my store with no comment or stars. I opened my account 12 years ago, tried selling some other stuff 2 times but couldnt do well. So, I am trying again with my own product now. Here is the link to check it out. The only sell I have is from my wife, yet! :)
