1mz2z1n,Notion really needs a ‚ÄúUser Mode‚Äù (separate from Edit Mode),"Hey Notion community,

I wanted to share a feature idea that I think could make Notion vastly more usable for everyday workflows. The problem is: **there is no way to separate ‚Äúcreator mode‚Äù from ‚Äúuser mode.‚Äù**

Right now, everything in Notion is always editable, which is great for building, but becomes distracting when you just want to use your tables, databases, or dashboards. Every interaction invites you to tweak properties, formulas, and layouts. For people trying to focus, this constant temptation can make task management stressful or inefficient.

The solution is simple but powerful: **Notion should have a ‚ÄúUser Mode‚Äù or ‚ÄúInteraction Mode.‚Äù**

Here‚Äôs what it could look like:

* Enter **Edit/Creator Mode** to configure databases, properties, formulas, views, and automations.
* Exit Creator Mode to simplify the interface: only elements you want interactive remain so (checkboxes, buttons, links, etc.). All other editing controls stay hidden unless you switch back.
* Users decide which parts of their setup stay interactive and which are locked.

This would effectively turn complex Notion setups into clean, usable apps for daily work, while keeping all the customization power intact. It‚Äôs like giving creators and users two separate experiences in the same workspace.

No other tool currently combines:

* Deep customization and flexibility
* Clean, distraction-free interaction
* The ability to selectively lock or hide editing controls

If implemented, this could make Notion **the ultimate productivity tool** for personal and team use. I hope the Notion team considers this‚Äîhaving a ‚ÄúUser Mode‚Äù would be a game-changer.

1mzs1me,"A Deep Dive into the ""Spaghetti Problem"" of Complex Notion Workspaces","Hello r/Notion,

Like many of you, I use Notion as a ""second brain."" But as my system grew with dozens of interconnected databases, I realized I had accidentally created a ""spaghetti mess."" I could feel the connections through relations and rollups, but I couldn't *see* the architecture. It was a black box.

This isn't just about aesthetics; it has real consequences:

* **Onboarding is difficult:** How do you explain a complex system to a new team member?
* **Hidden Dependencies:** A small change in one database can unknowingly break a workflow somewhere else.
* **Information Silos:** Databases become ""orphaned"" and forgotten, leading to outdated knowledge.

**My Approach to a Solution: Systems Thinking**

I decided to tackle this not as a software problem, but as a *systems problem*. The goal wasn't just to plot databases on a screen, but to create a visualization that was genuinely useful and intelligent.

My philosophy was based on two principles:

1. **Intelligent Layout:** The graph shouldn't be a random cloud of nodes. I developed a custom layout engine that uses algorithms inspired by graph theory (like simulated annealing) to actively untangle the connections, minimize line crossings, and reveal the underlying structure.
2. **Connection Analysis:** Not all relations are equal. The system also needed to analyze the *strength* of connections to identify which databases are true ""hubs"" in the workspace and which are merely satellites.

Here is a look at the dashboard I've been building based on these principles.

As you can see, the goal is to provide a clean overview of the system's architecture. But a static map isn't enough. The tool is interactive and built for deep analysis. For example, you can:

* **Search and Filter:** Instantly find specific databases by name or property, allowing you to focus only on the parts of the system you need to see.
* **Isolate ""Orphaned"" Databases:** A key feature is the ability to quickly identify and isolate databases that are not being interconnected, helping you find valuable knowledge that has lost its connection to your system.
* **Export Your Architecture:** Export the visual map of your workspace to different formats (like PNG or SVG) to include in documentation, presentations, or team reviews.

I'm sharing this deep dive because I'd love to get feedback from other power users on this *approach* to solving the problem. Do these principles resonate with the issues you face?",14,0.77,7,2025-08-25 14:30:24+00:00,One-Engine-1287,https://i.redd.it/oloqj2vkb6lf1.png,https://reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1mzs1me/a_deep_dive_into_the_spaghetti_problem_of_complex/,üß© API / Integrations,False,2025-08-25 23:56:00.250809+00:00

1mzmpnp,Automate project status updates based on related tasks statuses with Notion Automations,"I've made a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4zPcBVjLhQ) on setting up a Notion automation that automatically updates the status of a project based on the status of its related tasks.

It's not the most straightforward process, as you have to define a variable as part of the automation in order to be able to precisely target the right project within the edit property action.

This automation setup and logic can be applied to many different use cases and database setups, so getting the hang of it once is really going to be worth it.

1mzoaq6,5 Years with Notion: An Honest Take - but perhaps I am using my Notion PARA setup wrong.,"# Been using Notion for 5 years now and I'm stuck in the same frustrating cycle. Maybe others can relate?

**The endless loop:**

1. Spend hours/days tweaking Notion to fit my workflow perfectly
2. Use it enthusiastically for a few weeks/months
3. Gradually stop engaging with the complex setup
4. End up just using it as a glorified knowledge database
5. Get fed up and start over with a new setup
6. Repeat infinitely

**My biggest gripes:**

Notion is simultaneously too powerful and too finicky. The customization options are overwhelming, but more importantly, things constantly break or don't show up because I missed some obscure filter setting or database property. I'll be looking for a note I KNOW exists, only to discover it's hidden because of some view configuration I forgot about.

It *could* be perfect, but it's not. The gap between potential and reality is maddening.

**What I actually want (and what's inevitable):**

A truly intelligent, zero-setup productivity system. Something that:

* Automatically summarizes my meetings and schedules follow-ups
* Reminds me of tasks based on context from my emails/messages
* Tracks projects without me having to build elaborate database schemas
* Just... works without constant maintenance

Right now I'm experimenting with ChatGPT Projects as a super basic version of this vision. I dump everything into it and get contextually aware responses based on my evolving knowledge base. No setup, no maintenance, just intelligence.

**The bottom line:** I'm done with apps that require me to become a database administrator just to track my life. The technology exists for something better - we just need someone to build it.
