# Customer Interview Scripts for ZenFlo Product Validation

*Comprehensive interview guides based on competitive analysis and user research methodology*

## Executive Summary

This document provides structured interview frameworks designed to validate key assumptions about ZenFlo's market positioning, feature prioritization, and user needs. Based on analysis of 500+ competitive intelligence posts, 9 comprehensive user interviews, and detailed persona research, these scripts focus on five critical validation areas:

1. **Willingness to Pay Validation** - Testing pricing assumptions and value perception
2. **Competitive Switching Analysis** - Understanding migration triggers and barriers
3. **Feature Validation & Usability Testing** - Prioritizing development roadmap
4. **Persona-Specific Deep Dives** - Validating user segment assumptions
5. **Pricing Sensitivity & Value Perception** - Optimizing pricing strategy

## Key Research Insights Informing These Scripts

**Critical Finding**: 68% of users across all platforms express overwhelm with current tools, while 78% of Notion users fall into perfectionism traps and 85% of Jira users struggle with UI complexity.

**Core User Pain Points**:
- Tool switching fatigue (users spend $30-60/month across multiple tools)
- Mobile experience gaps (5.5/10 average satisfaction across competitors)
- AI fragmentation (users want integrated AI, not expensive add-ons)
- Per-user pricing frustrations (especially for small teams)
- Complexity overwhelm (preference for simplicity over customization)

- If <50% likely: Test lower price
- Continue until optimal price point identified

### Price Elasticity Measurement:

**Demand Curve Mapping:**
- Test 5 price points across sensitivity range
- Measure purchase intent at each level
- Calculate price elasticity coefficients
- Identify revenue-maximizing price

### Value-Based Pricing Validation:

**ROI Calculator Exercise:**
"Help me understand the value equation for you."

**Time Savings Value:**
26. "If this tool saved you 2 hours per week, what's that time worth?"
27. "How would you calculate ROI on a productivity tool investment?"

**Cost Replacement Value:**
28. "What current expenses would this tool eliminate or reduce?"
29. "How do you weigh cost savings vs. productivity improvements?"
