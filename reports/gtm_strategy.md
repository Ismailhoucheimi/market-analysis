- Users value simplicity over customization by a 3:1 margin

**Go-to-Market Approach:**
1. **Channel Strategy**: Community-driven growth through Reddit, productivity forums, and influencer partnerships
2. **Content Marketing**: Educational content targeting competitor pain points
3. **Partnership Strategy**: Integration partnerships with calendar, email, and communication tools
