Looking for 5 beta testers\n\nHey r/Notion,\n\nI've lurked here for months and see the same pain everywhere: \n\nWe build amazing systems in Notion, then can't figure out what we actually built.\n\nThe breaking point? I spent 3 hours last weekend trying to trace why deleting one rollup would break my entire finance tracker.\n\nWe need more than database views and filters. We need to see the big picture, \n\nhow everything connects, what depends on what, where our data actually flows.\n\nSo I built something: :)\n\na tool that scans your workspace and shows you the complete map of your database relationships.\n\nHere's what it found in my \"simple\" setup:\n\n- 14+ databases I forgot I had\n- Rollup chains 4 levels deep  \n- Formula dependencies I never realized existed\n\nThe graph shows clusters of related databases. Click any node to see what it connects to. \n\nFinally understand the monster you created.\n\nNow I'm looking for 5 people from this community to test it out and give feedback.\n\n Especially interested in:\n\n- Complex workspace owners (50 +  databases)\n- People who use lots of rollups/formulas\n- Anyone who's ever been scared to delete something\n\n----> Drop a comment if you're interested. Will DM the first few people.\n\n trying to build a solution :)\n",

What I have so far is a database that holds entries for specific days (Monday's show, etc) that sets the daily date automatically. Then inside I'd like to have two columns, on where I can grab a page with a prepped break filled with information, and then move it over to the other side and drop it into a filtered linked view of the same database and it categorizes itself based off of the hour (say 6am) and the time during that hour/break number (break 1, break 2, etc). I have a system that works pretty good, but if I want to put the same break in say 6am - Break 1, as well as 7am - Break 3 I can't seem to find a way to do that without it messing up all the filters. I've tried having the \"break numbers\" in a multi select, but that doesn't seem to work.    \n  \nIf this makes sense and someone has some tips they could share I'd greatly appreciate it!  ",

          "selftext": "Hello guys,\n\nFirst of all please don't be rush on me. I am new at this kind of things, and I don't know how to promote my hard worked product well since I don't have a good social media account as well. You don't have to buy to support me, your constructive feedback or any recommendation will be as valuable, and will be appreciated.\n\nSo, I am here to give it a shot and promote you the habit tracker I created in about a week, without copying anyone's work or AI's work (except for the formula and script). Here are the features I placed in my habit tracker:\n________\nFor Google Sheets --> So you need only a Google account. Compatible with all devices and operation systems. NOT FOR NOTION!\n\nSmart setup --> just enter your month, year, age, and gender. The calendar auto-adjusts to the right number of days, highlights today and show the day names as a real calendar.\nSleep & hydration goals are auto-calculated using WHO recommendations according to your age and gender. I believe it is a unique feature.\n\nDefine up to 30 habits --> each with custom goals & 11 categories to choose from.\n\nCategory tracking --> you can track the progress of the categories in addition to the habits with progress bars and donut pie. I didn't see other trackers do it like that so far. \n\nInstant progress tracking --> daily check-ins with color-coded bars for habits as well as for days. Auto percentages & progress bars update as you go. They also adapt to your goal and number of habits.\n\nGamified medals system --> earn bronze, silver, gold medals for each habit and also for each day. Daily medals check your consistency consistency based on how many habits you completed in a day.\n\nSleep & Hydration Tracker --> auto-goals based on your age & gender. Color-coded daily entries + monthly line graph for trends.\n\nOne-click PDF export --> have monthly reports automatically with the right month/year in the filename.\n\nEasy reset button --> cears all checkboxes with a safety check, so you don't accidentally clear your progress.\n\nEverything in one tab --> people promote as more than is better, but I think it is the reverse for simplification. No need to click around multiple sheets in my tracker.\n\nReusable forever --> just change the month/year, reset, and you\u2019re ready to go again. \n________\n\nAlright this what I have for you. I believe it has some unique features that other habit trackers don't have like easy cleaning, printing to PDF, auto wellness goals and category tracking instead of only habits. I might be wrong but this is what I saw so far. Gamification is also not very common, and I think it makes it more fun to develop habit or routines \ud83d\ude00\n\nI sell it with 50% discount on Etsy now as a kick off. (Anywhere else as a recommendation?) Don't be scared when you see my store with no comment or stars. I opened my account 12 years ago, tried selling some other stuff 2 times but couldnt do well. So, I am trying again with my own product now. Here is the link to check it out. The only sell I have is from my wife, yet! :)\n\nhttps://creativefolios.etsy.com/listing/4357789171\n\nComment if you have questions or DM me. Thanks in advance for buying my tracker or giving me a feedback! Appreciate it both.",

Most of my meetings are scheduled through Google Calendar and often include meeting links and recurring events.\n\nI\u2019m trying to pull these calendar events into Notion, but it looks like Notion has trouble syncing recurring events from Google Calendar. On the flip side, I\u00a0can\u00a0create recurring tasks directly in Notion, and they do show up in Notion Calendar, which I\u2019m planning to use as my main calendar moving forward.\n\nJust wondering if anyone\u2019s found a good workaround for importing events? I would think that there should be a way to have the Google Calendar events imported directly into the Notion Database, but can't seem to find the settings. Would love to hear how others are handling it.\n\nEdit: Quick note, looking for a solution that doesn't involve subscribing. Currently unemployed recent graduate so I don't have the funds for that.",

          "selftext": "Hey Notion community,\n\nI wanted to share a feature idea that I think could make Notion vastly more usable for everyday workflows. The problem is: **there is no way to separate \u201ccreator mode\u201d from \u201cuser mode.\u201d**\n\nRight now, everything in Notion is always editable, which is great for building, but becomes distracting when you just want to use your tables, databases, or dashboards. Every interaction invites you to tweak properties, formulas, and layouts. For people trying to focus, this constant temptation can make task management stressful or inefficient.\n\nThe solution is simple but powerful: **Notion should have a \u201cUser Mode\u201d or \u201cInteraction Mode.\u201d**\n\nHere\u2019s what it could look like:\n\n* Enter **Edit/Creator Mode** to configure databases, properties, formulas, views, and automations.\n* Exit Creator Mode to simplify the interface: only elements you want interactive remain so (checkboxes, buttons, links, etc.). All other editing controls stay hidden unless you switch back.\n* Users decide which parts of their setup stay interactive and which are locked.\n\nThis would effectively turn complex Notion setups into clean, usable apps for daily work, while keeping all the customization power intact. It\u2019s like giving creators and users two separate experiences in the same workspace.\n\nNo other tool currently combines:\n\n* Deep customization and flexibility\n* Clean, distraction-free interaction\n* The ability to selectively lock or hide editing controls\n\nIf implemented, this could make Notion **the ultimate productivity tool** for personal and team use. I hope the Notion team considers this\u2014having a \u201cUser Mode\u201d would be a game-changer.\n\n  \nWhat do you think?",

          "selftext": "Hello r/Notion,\n\nLike many of you, I use Notion as a \"second brain.\" But as my system grew with dozens of interconnected databases, I realized I had accidentally created a \"spaghetti mess.\" I could feel the connections through relations and rollups, but I couldn't *see* the architecture. It was a black box.\n\nThis isn't just about aesthetics; it has real consequences:\n\n* **Onboarding is difficult:** How do you explain a complex system to a new team member?\n* **Hidden Dependencies:** A small change in one database can unknowingly break a workflow somewhere else.\n* **Information Silos:** Databases become \"orphaned\" and forgotten, leading to outdated knowledge.\n\n**My Approach to a Solution: Systems Thinking**\n\nI decided to tackle this not as a software problem, but as a *systems problem*. The goal wasn't just to plot databases on a screen, but to create a visualization that was genuinely useful and intelligent.\n\nMy philosophy was based on two principles:\n\n1. **Intelligent Layout:** The graph shouldn't be a random cloud of nodes. I developed a custom layout engine that uses algorithms inspired by graph theory (like simulated annealing) to actively untangle the connections, minimize line crossings, and reveal the underlying structure.\n2. **Connection Analysis:** Not all relations are equal. The system also needed to analyze the *strength* of connections to identify which databases are true \"hubs\" in the workspace and which are merely satellites.\n\nHere is a look at the dashboard I've been building based on these principles.\n\nAs you can see, the goal is to provide a clean overview of the system's architecture. But a static map isn't enough. The tool is interactive and built for deep analysis. For example, you can:\n\n* **Search and Filter:** Instantly find specific databases by name or property, allowing you to focus only on the parts of the system you need to see.\n* **Isolate \"Orphaned\" Databases:** A key feature is the ability to quickly identify and isolate databases that are not being interconnected, helping you find valuable knowledge that has lost its connection to your system.\n* **Export Your Architecture:** Export the visual map of your workspace to different formats (like PNG or SVG) to include in documentation, presentations, or team reviews.\n\nI'm sharing this deep dive because I'd love to get feedback from other power users on this *approach* to solving the problem. Do these principles resonate with the issues you face?",

          "selftext": "# Been using Notion for 5 years now and I'm stuck in the same frustrating cycle. Maybe others can relate?\n\n**The endless loop:**\n\n1. Spend hours/days tweaking Notion to fit my workflow perfectly\n2. Use it enthusiastically for a few weeks/months\n3. Gradually stop engaging with the complex setup\n4. End up just using it as a glorified knowledge database\n5. Get fed up and start over with a new setup\n6. Repeat infinitely\n\n**My biggest gripes:**\n\nNotion is simultaneously too powerful and too finicky. The customization options are overwhelming, but more importantly, things constantly break or don't show up because I missed some obscure filter setting or database property. I'll be looking for a note I KNOW exists, only to discover it's hidden because of some view configuration I forgot about.\n\nIt *could* be perfect, but it's not. The gap between potential and reality is maddening.\n\n**What I actually want (and what's inevitable):**\n\nA truly intelligent, zero-setup productivity system. Something that:\n\n* Automatically summarizes my meetings and schedules follow-ups\n* Reminds me of tasks based on context from my emails/messages\n* Tracks projects without me having to build elaborate database schemas\n* Just... works without constant maintenance\n\nRight now I'm experimenting with ChatGPT Projects as a super basic version of this vision. I dump everything into it and get contextually aware responses based on my evolving knowledge base. No setup, no maintenance, just intelligence.\n\n**The bottom line:** I'm done with apps that require me to become a database administrator just to track my life. The technology exists for something better - we just need someone to build it.\n\nAnyone else feeling this Notion fatigue? What are you using instead?",
