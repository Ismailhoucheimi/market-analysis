Then inside I'd like to have two columns, on where I can grab a page with a prepped break filled with information, and then move it over to the other side and drop it into a filtered linked view of the same database and it categorizes itself based off of the hour (say 6am) and the time during that hour/break number (break 1, break 2, etc). I have a system that works pretty good, but if I want to put the same break in say 6am - Break 1, as well as 7am - Break 3 I can't seem to find a way to do that without it messing up all the filters. I've tried having the \"break numbers\" in a multi select, but that doesn't seem to work.    \n  \nIf this makes sense and someone has some tips they could share I'd greatly appreciate it!  ",

Looking for 5 beta testers\n\nHey r/Notion,\n\nI've lurked here for months and see the same pain everywhere: \n\nWe build amazing systems in Notion, then can't figure out what we actually built.\n\nThe breaking point? I spent 3 hours last weekend trying to trace why deleting one rollup would break my entire finance tracker.\n\nWe need more than database views and filters. We need to see the big picture, \n\nhow everything connects, what depends on what, where our data actually flows.\n\nSo I built something: :)\n\na tool that scans your workspace and shows you the complete map of your database relationships.\n\nHere's what it found in my \"simple\" setup:\n\n- 14+ databases I forgot I had\n- Rollup chains 4 levels deep  \n- Formula dependencies I never realized existed\n\nThe graph shows clusters of related databases. Click any node to see what it connects to. \n\nFinally understand the monster you created.\n\nNow I'm looking for 5 people from this community to test it out and give feedback.\n\n Especially interested in:\n\n- Complex workspace owners (50 +  databases)\n- People who use lots of rollups/formulas\n- Anyone who's ever been scared to delete something\n\n----> Drop a comment if you're interested. Will DM the first few people.\n\n trying to build a solution :)\n",

I manage around 150 jobs at any given time. \nI\u2019m using Google sheets with the following fields: client, designer, due date, current stage, stage due, next stage, and two additional columns to note the date a procedure has been outsourced or a part ordered and to / from whom. \nEach client has a row, so the spreadsheet is approx 150 rows long. \nMy issue is that I\u2019m sure my workload has outgrown this format. I need to rely on a database giving me prompts for things being due, staying stagnant for too long, etc, rather than just reflecting where something is currently at. I\u2019m hoping for a lot more automation to make this tracking more efficient rather than being so manual and time consuming. \n\nI\u2019ve done a deep dive on project management software, Gantt charts, Kanban tables and the like, but none seem quite right. \nI love the way Notion appears to work, and the fact I can integrate a dashboard with daily tasks and other things, basically creating a hub for my work overall, as well as this spreadsheet. I also love the potential for automated functions - I can see for example that Zapier can talk to my CRM to autofill some things for me. \nBut can a Notion table be set up to do what I\u2019m asking? Or am I better off just using the dashboard functionality and linking it to my Google sheet which, in turn, I could potentially learn to better automate? I\u2019m going around in circles and on many tangents with my YouTubing trying to find the answer. I\u2019m searching templates but can\u2019t find anything quite right, though I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just not using the right words (project management, production management, workflow). \nI appreciate any insights!\n",

I\u2019ve added a lot of new features, changed the structure of the database at its core, and overall made it very different in terms of function. The only part that\u2019s mostly similar is the layout.\n\nHere\u2019s the tricky part:\n\n* The original template creator included a lot of content with pictures.\n* After digging, I found out that those pictures actually came from a website (not owned by the template creator).\n* I rewrote the content myself based on my own knowledge, so the text is original now.\n* However, I\u2019d like to keep many of the same pictures for instructional purposes, since they fit really well. I *could* replace them with other images from the internet, but most of the ones I want are already in the template.\n\nMy plan is to sell this modified template, but I\u2019m unsure whether keeping those pictures could cause copyright issues. Since the template creator used them from some website, does that make it risky for me to resell a version with the same images? Or would it be safer to replace them all with alternatives I know I can use?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts from anyone who has dealt with similar copyright/template situations.",

          "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m trying to set up a system in Notion for a game project. I currently have two databases:\n\n1. **Types Database** \u2013 Each type has its weaknesses, and resistances.\n2. **Creatures Database** \u2013 Each creature can have one or several types.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to achieve is: whenever I open a creature\u2019s page, I want to see a table that automatically shows its **weaknesses and resistances** based on its assigned types (like in the screenshot attached).  \nIn this logic, I only edit the **Types Database** to define or modify strengths, weaknesses, and resistances. The **Creatures Database** should just reflect these automatically, without me having to manually update each creature.\n\nFor example (similar to the logic in Pok\u00e9mon):\n\n* A creature in the table should display something like :\n   * Very Weak to: Type 1\n   * Weak to: Type 2\n   * Resistant to: Type 3\n   * Very Resistant to: Type 4, Type 5\n\nThe problem I\u2019m facing is that I get stuck with **nested rollups**. I can roll up the weaknesses and resistances of each type, but I can\u2019t seem to combine them properly across multiple types. For example, if a creature has two types that are both weak to the same type, I\u2019d like that to show up as a **\u201cdouble weakness\u201d** instead of just a normal weakness. Same issue for **double resistances**.\n\nIs there any way to achieve this in Notion with relations/rollups, or a workaround to detect and display these combined effects?",

I'm hoping someone can help me figure this out.\n\nMy goal is to create a property that displays entries from a related database, but only if that item meets a certain condition. \n\n* I have a Books database, and a Notes database. I've set up a relation going both directions, and also rollups showing the related items on each (related Notes rollup in Books, and vice versa). \n* They don't always relate 1:1, so I've created a \"select\" property within Notes for the following types: Reading Notes (highlights from a single book), and Topic Notes (where I can aggregate info from multiple books and tie them together). \n* I have a Currently Reading block, which is a filtered view of the Books database, showing books in progress. It also shows the rollup property with related Notes entries.\n\n**What I can't figure out**: Is there a way to filter these displayed Notes entries so that *only* Reading Notes show up on this view? \n\nFrom my searching so far I understand that we can only filter *based on* rollups, but we can't filter the rollup properties themselves. I'm open to rearranging the setup if there is something else that might work. I've only just started dabbling with formulas, and I don't have coding experience, but I enjoy this kind of thing so I'm open to learning. \n\nThanks in advance!",

But what that does  is create a shared workspace, which then puts you on a countdown timer to pay Notion within 30 days for a plan that allows shared workspaces. I went through hell trying to figure out how to untangle and unshare / delete my shared workspace that took days. \n\nThis is a big gotcha for Notion, the second you share anything, it creates these shared workspaces and they try to charge you money within a set time period to unlock / use the workspace. I don't want to share a workspace, I just want to share the contents of 1 document that's on one account with another account. \n\nYou would think this might be simpler but, you can't even highlight all the text in a Notion document or click CTRL+A , CTRL+C to get everything since it's divided into cells and you can't seem to copy everything. \n\nSo, excuse the rambling but my question, IS there a way to share or copy the contents of a document between notion accounts WITHOUT ENDING UP IN A SUBSCRIPTION or in a situation where you are paying money to ultimately share the contents of a document?

          "selftext": "Hello guys,\n\nFirst of all please don't be rush on me. I am new at this kind of things, and I don't know how to promote my hard worked product well since I don't have a good social media account as well. You don't have to buy to support me, your constructive feedback or any recommendation will be as valuable, and will be appreciated.\n\nSo, I am here to give it a shot and promote you the habit tracker I created in about a week, without copying anyone's work or AI's work (except for the formula and script). Here are the features I placed in my habit tracker:\n________\nFor Google Sheets --> So you need only a Google account. Compatible with all devices and operation systems. NOT FOR NOTION!\n\nSmart setup --> just enter your month, year, age, and gender. The calendar auto-adjusts to the right number of days, highlights today and show the day names as a real calendar.\nSleep & hydration goals are auto-calculated using WHO recommendations according to your age and gender. I believe it is a unique feature.\n\nDefine up to 30 habits --> each with custom goals & 11 categories to choose from.\n\nCategory tracking --> you can track the progress of the categories in addition to the habits with progress bars and donut pie. I didn't see other trackers do it like that so far. \n\nInstant progress tracking --> daily check-ins with color-coded bars for habits as well as for days. Auto percentages & progress bars update as you go. They also adapt to your goal and number of habits.\n\nGamified medals system --> earn bronze, silver, gold medals for each habit and also for each day. Daily medals check your consistency consistency based on how many habits you completed in a day.\n\nSleep & Hydration Tracker --> auto-goals based on your age & gender. Color-coded daily entries + monthly line graph for trends.\n\nOne-click PDF export --> have monthly reports automatically with the right month/year in the filename.\n\nEasy reset button --> cears all checkboxes with a safety check, so you don't accidentally clear your progress.\n\nEverything in one tab --> people promote as more than is better, but I think it is the reverse for simplification. No need to click around multiple sheets in my tracker.\n\nReusable forever --> just change the month/year, reset, and you\u2019re ready to go again. \n________\n\nAlright this what I have for you. I believe it has some unique features that other habit trackers don't have like easy cleaning, printing to PDF, auto wellness goals and category tracking instead of only habits. I might be wrong but this is what I saw so far. Gamification is also not very common, and I think it makes it more fun to develop habit or routines \ud83d\ude00\n\nI sell it with 50% discount on Etsy now as a kick off. (Anywhere else as a recommendation?) Don't be scared when you see my store with no comment or stars. I opened my account 12 years ago, tried selling some other stuff 2 times but couldnt do well. So, I am trying again with my own product now. Here is the link to check it out. The only sell I have is from my wife, yet! :)\n\nhttps://creativefolios.etsy.com/listing/4357789171\n\nComment if you have questions or DM me. Thanks in advance for buying my tracker or giving me a feedback! Appreciate it both.",

It\u2019s not bloated, it\u2019s not pretending to be a second brain \u2014 it\u2019s just a clean and simple productivity system built in Notion, with:\n\n* AI prompt libraries already integrated\n* Habit + task + goal tracking in one view\n* Smart views & filters for focused work\n* Minimal, distraction-free UI\n\n\n\nNot for everyone \u2014 but if you\u2019re into Notion and want an organized space that\u2019s ready to go, you might like it.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 You can preview it here: [Optimize](https://optimizeai.framer.ai)\n\nI\u2019m still keeping the **$19 offer** up (was $25) for now, but after this I\u2019ll probably stop promoting it.\n\n[Main Dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/tyvtlh5i5jkf1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cd7b8e8a4996fcb1f2f8e9f27950a10b3fc59f2)\n\nHappy to answer any questions.  \n",

It was a complete graveyard for good ideas\u2014hundreds of Reels saved for \"later,\" but impossible to find when I actually needed inspiration.\n\nSo, I built a system to fix it, and I wanted to share it with you all for free.\n\nIt's a minimalist **Content Library template**, but the real magic is that it's designed to work with a **one-tap iOS Shortcut**.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* You find an inspiring Reel on Instagram.\n* You hit the \"Share\" button and run the shortcut.\n* It prompts you to add your own notes and a category.\n* In seconds, the Reel link and your thoughts are sent directly to this organized Notion database.\n\nIt\u2019s been a game-changer for me, turning that chaos into a searchable, useful library.\n\nThe template is now live on the Notion Marketplace for free.\n\nI'm building out a whole \"Creator's OS\" with more tools like this, so a follow on instagram ( [vznkai](https://www.instagram.com/vznkai/) ) would mean a lot if you find it valuable.

Would love any **feedback or ideas** on how I can effectively improve this template for you and other property hosts.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m sharing this template for free. If anyone wants the link, leave a comment and I'll DM it to you or post in the comments.\n\nI'm using this tracker as part of my complete Notion system for short term rental management. The Notion system includes customisable dashboards to manage and track guest bookings, cleaning tasks, expenses and the inventory of your properties in one centralised place. You can also view performance highlights for your properties and bookings with the help of Notions\u2019s chart views.\n\nHappy to share more, if you are interested.",

They felt like a chore to maintain.\n\nI wanted something that made life\u00a0*feel*\u00a0like a game\u2014but a game that\u2019s worth playing. No gimmicks. No fake rewards.

I had been searching for the ideal solution for years.\n\nA short introduction of me: I work as senior designer for a design agency in Philadelphia (USA) and as a freelancer. In my free time, I love organizing my life to improve my productivity (and that\u2019s why I love Notion).\n\nBack then, I searched for a budgeting app that checked all these boxes:\n\n1. **\u2060\u2060Beautiful Design:** A sleek, modern, and user-friendly interface is essential to me. I want something that feels enjoyable to use every day.\n2. **\u2060Bank Integration**: It should connect with European banks (via Plaid or similar services). While this is a major advantage, I'm also fine with manual input if the app offers excellent features.\n3. **\u2060Widgets for Quick Entries**: I'd love widgets that simplify adding transactions, ideally with receipt scanning capabilities!\n4. **\u2060AI Features**: Automatic expense categorization (and other smart features) would be fantastic for saving time and maintaining organization.\n\nSadly, my search didn\u2019t yield the result I was aiming at, so I finally decided to build my own system on Notion \u2014it allows you to create what fits best your needs.\n\nThese features were just the starting points for my product goals. I began to brainstorm the best Notion templates available and analyze the top financial apps like YNAB, Albert, Spendee, Mint, Monarch, Copilot, and classic Excel sheets. I evaluated the pros and cons of each product, looking for ways to improve existing features or add missing ones.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcfi1a5u6sjf1.png?width=4022&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7fcdb5a722ea38a594e6602ea89974ddc9f9071\n\n**KEY FEATURES:**\n\n**Good Design:** As a designer, I couldn't overlook the aspect\u2014clear and minimal interface with careful attention to detail and user experience.\n\n**Bank Integration:** You'll receive a guide to connect all your banks to your system using Plaid, one of the safest connection methods available.\n\n**Widget for quick entries:** Two iOS shortcuts will be available\u2014one for scanning receipts to automatically add and categorize transactions using AI (capturing transaction name, date, amount, and more), and another for those who prefer adding transactions manually but quickly.\n\nHere a spoiler of the most requested feature:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/k31cbgbomzjf1.gif\n\n* **Mobile friendly and responsive**\n* **50/30/20 Needs, wants and saving role**\n* **Advanced Automations - Auto Relations**\n* **Graph Insights view**\n* **Monthly/yearly reports**\n* **Set Budget categories**\n* **Goals Tracker**\n* **Import with CSV**\n* **Payments Notification reminder**\n* **Subscription Tracker**\n* **Balance transfers**\n* **Duplicate remover**\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Launch in 5 days: Automated Notion Finance System  \n\ud83d\udc49 Get **50% OFF the PRO Plan ($59 \u2192 $29)**\n\n\u2192 **Upvote** this post  \n\u2192 Comment **\u201cEarly Access\u201d**  \n(I\u2019ll DM you the code \u2013 limited to 30 people, valid 48h)\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Want it **FREE**?  \nThe first 10 people who follow the rules on my last Twitter/Threads post will get the **Plus Plan 100% OFF**.

It worked, but someone recently suggested I switch to Notion to keep everything digital and on my phone.\n\nI gave it a try, looked up a bunch of templates, and even tried building a dashboard myself\u2026 but after hours of tweaking and countless chatGPT calls, I gave up. Most templates I found feel too bloated \u2014 packed with calorie counters, embedded YouTube tutorials, or fitness fluff that\u2019s just not useful when you\u2019re in the middle of a workout.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for is something\u00a0**simple, functional, and made for people who actually train**. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d love to have in a Notion setup:\n\n* \u00a0**Mobile-friendly**\u00a0and easy to use while working out\n* \u00a0**Templates for routines**: I want to select the workout of the day and just fill in my performance for each set AND THAT'S IT\n* \u00a0**Default warm-up/cool-down included**\u00a0(I usually start with 15 min jump rope and end with crunches)\n* \u00a0**Goal tracking per exercise**: ideally it shows the last performance of that exercise so I know what to aim for\n* \u00a0**Optional long-term progress tracking**\u00a0(graphs, tables \u2014 not a priority, but nice to have)\n\nIf anyone has something like this set up already, I\u2019d love to see it.

The problem is: **there is no way to separate \u201ccreator mode\u201d from \u201cuser mode.\u201d**\n\nRight now, everything in Notion is always editable, which is great for building, but becomes distracting when you just want to use your tables, databases, or dashboards. Every interaction invites you to tweak properties, formulas, and layouts. For people trying to focus, this constant temptation can make task management stressful or inefficient.\n\nThe solution is simple but powerful: **Notion should have a \u201cUser Mode\u201d or \u201cInteraction Mode.\u201d**\n\nHere\u2019s what it could look like:\n\n* Enter **Edit/Creator Mode** to configure databases, properties, formulas, views, and automations.\n* Exit Creator Mode to simplify the interface: only elements you want interactive remain so (checkboxes, buttons, links, etc.). All other editing controls stay hidden unless you switch back.\n* Users decide which parts of their setup stay interactive and which are locked.\n\nThis would effectively turn complex Notion setups into clean, usable apps for daily work, while keeping all the customization power intact. It\u2019s like giving creators and users two separate experiences in the same workspace.\n\nNo other tool currently combines:\n\n* Deep customization and flexibility\n* Clean, distraction-free interaction\n* The ability to selectively lock or hide editing controls\n\nIf implemented, this could make Notion **the ultimate productivity tool** for personal and team use. I hope the Notion team considers this\u2014having a \u201cUser Mode\u201d would be a game-changer.\n\n  \nWhat do you think?",

It showed stat blocks from a separate database of monsters, tracked their AC, Health, and a manual input for dmg. Defeated enemies would be auto-filtered out. \n\nIt worked but I opted for other programs. However, I'd like to dust this tracker off and try to take advantage of the new buttons, conditional formatting and any improvements I could include. \n\nDo folks have ideas on how this tracker could be improved or streamlined? I tried to do conditional formatting if the number in the damage column matched the monster's max HP but this didn't work. Buttons that do different things would be great like dice rolling if possible. \n\nAnyway, I'm looking to take advantage of new data see features to try and improve this. Thanks so much! ",

What features are on your wishlist for this event?   \n  \nHere\u2019s my perspective: Notion is gearing up for something monumental, possibly the biggest update in its history\u2014Notion 3.0. There have been numerous hints over the past few months. Notion 2.0 was released back in 2018. Why do I believe there will be significant new features? Consider this: Notion introduced Offline mode and Advanced Notion AI just last month. If you were hosting a major conference, you wouldn\u2019t release major features beforehand to save the \u201cWow\u201d effect for the event. The only reason they might have done so is that they have so many extensive features (Notion 3.0) that there wasn\u2019t room for these others. What are your thoughts?",

Ideally, it could either recognize the speaker directly or at least tag them as \u201cSpeaker 1, Speaker 2,\u201d etc., so you can later replace those with the actual names. That way, you\u2019d be able to search specifically for what a certain person said in a meeting.\n\nI\u2019ve used this feature in Krisp before and found it super useful, but paying for multiple app subscriptions just to get that one function feels like overkill.

It would be fun to add/check an alcoholic beverage/drink and quantity, and by adding/checking that, it automatically checks the box for alcohol. Example: I add 1 beer, it automatically checks I had alcohol for that day.\n\nSame thing would be cool for, say, medicine, but instead of checking the medicine checkbox for the day automatically when checking for a single medicine, checking it only when all different medicine are taken. (I know that there are plenty of other apps that do that, even the iOS Health app, it's just an example and a mental exercise). \n\nIs it possible to do that? How would such a thing be possible? I don't even know how to proceed with the counting, if it should be a number property, or if it can be detected from text, or if it should be another checkbox for the specific beverage with no counting... if it is possible, I imagine the Alcohol property would then be a formula that outputs a checked checkbox, if so would I still be able to manually check it?

Minor changes, which broke a number of filters, caused some pages to lose their links, and had different people creating pages from different versions.  \n  \nThe frustrating part is that we can't easily tell which pages are aligned with the current template.  There's no straight \u201cdiff\u201d to see what has changed, and if we want to roll back changes, it would have to be done by manually undoing all of the changes.  We also don't have a safe process for experimenting with changes by a pilot before rolling them out.  \n  \nHow are your teams solving this problem?  Do you manage versions of templates in some way, or stages of the changes?  Is there a way for you to audit other pages for \u201cconformance\u201d to the latest template?    \n  \nplease,can anyone share tips, naming conventions, or features/tools in Notion or 3rd party that worked for you?",

Shortly afterwards, I logged out of my account on google chrome from my mac to log in via the desktop version.\n\nOn my notion desktop, I logged in with said account and suddenly everything was lost. I lost information on my university notes and assignments, class schedules, deadlines, and other personal management systems.\n\nBut what became the nail in the coffin for me was how I am also using notion to manage my club as a president. Now I\u2019ve lost my club\u2019s operations database, membership details, fund allocations, Terms of Reference that I have been working on my whole semester break with my committee members.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to think, say, or do at the moment because this made me feel so bad. Especially when I also run my small business doing art commissions where I track everything on the app.\n\nI have emailed Notion about my issue and have requested a ticket from their website. I hope I can  update you guys further with good news. As of now I can only vent. \n\nSpeaking of my club, Semester is starting in like a week from now and I drafted all my necessary documents on notion for me to publish and send to the university department for review. I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me at this time since I\u2019ve been using this app since 2020 during covid in secondary school.\n",

          "selftext": "Hey r/Notion,\n\nI'm pulling my hair out over this Notion Mail bug and hoping someone here has run into it or knows a fix. I've been trying to use the 'Schedule Outreach' template (or just inserting a scheduling snippet) in Notion Mail, but every time I hit send, I get stuck with \"Scheduling link still loading\" message. The email never goes out.\n\nHere's the weird part:\n\n* My Notion Calendar is connected perfectly to Google Calendar \u2013 no issues there.\n* In Notion Mail, the mini-calendar view pops up fine, shows my Google Calendar events, and even lets me add availability slots without a hitch.\n* But as soon as I try to finalize and send the email, it hangs on that loading error indefinitely.\n\nI've already tried:\n\n* Reconnecting Notion Calendar multiple times.\n* Clearing cache, restarting the app/browser, and even trying different browsers.\n* Manually creating scheduling links in Notion Calendar and pasting them in (still fails when sending).\n* Ensuring all permissions are set in Google Calendar (public sharing, full access granted).\n\nThis started happening right after I set everything up and happens in both browser and macos apps. I'm on macOS, using the latest Notion app, and my setup is pretty standard \u2013 nothing fancy.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Is there a hidden setting I'm missing, or a reliable workaround (like third-party sync tools)? Appreciate any advice!\n\nThanks!",

          "selftext": "I've been battling **critical deep link bugs since January 2025** that make Notion essentially unusable for external customer support. Despite upgrading to Enterprise specifically for better support, I'm still getting nowhere after 9+ months. Is this happening to anyone else? Any suggestions for how to actually get attention from Notion?\n\n**The core issue:** Deep links to toggle content work inconsistently or fail completely across different browsers/conditions:\n\n* \u2705 Work when signed into Notion\n* \u274c Fail for users not signed into Notion (aka 99% of my customers)\n* \u274c Broken on Android Chrome (\\~1/3 of users)\n* \u274c Get \"stuck\" on wrong sections when multiple toggles are open\n\n**Why this matters:** We built our entire company FAQ system in Notion with thousands of users depending on it. I specifically chose Notion FOR the deep linking capability. Now I'm constantly telling customers \"sorry, Notion has bugs, the links might not work.\"\n\n**Support experience:** after 9 months it's just \"engineering is still working on it\" with zero concrete timeline. They've acknowledged it's not a widespread issue but affects specific conditions - which happen to be exactly how external users access our content.\n\n**Has anyone else experienced this?** Specifically:\n\n* Deep links failing for non-Notion users\n* Inconsistent behavior across browsers/devices\n* Toggle links not opening/scrolling correctly\n\nI'm seriously considering migrating our entire knowledge base off Notion. For an Enterprise customer paying premium prices, this level of broken core functionality is unacceptable.\n\nHere are two specific examples that work when signed into Notion, but not when not signed in:\n\nLink 1:\u00a0[smart calendar](https://www.notion.so/honeycomb-parenting/How-to-everything-Honeycomb-FAQs-1924cca343c380e99095d411a8876d57?source=copy_link#1f24cca343c380b1a4c7d50e0ad58457)\n\nLink 2:\u00a0[maximize IRL connection](https://www.notion.so/honeycomb-parenting/How-to-everything-Honeycomb-FAQs-1924cca343c380e99095d411a8876d57?source=copy_link#2314cca343c380fc8d65c0a1749436f7)\n\n**UPDATE:** Just tested again today - the issue persists across all scenarios mentioned above.",

          "selftext": "Hello r/Notion,\n\nLike many of you, I use Notion as a \"second brain.\" But as my system grew with dozens of interconnected databases, I realized I had accidentally created a \"spaghetti mess.\" I could feel the connections through relations and rollups, but I couldn't *see* the architecture. It was a black box.\n\nThis isn't just about aesthetics; it has real consequences:\n\n* **Onboarding is difficult:** How do you explain a complex system to a new team member?\n* **Hidden Dependencies:** A small change in one database can unknowingly break a workflow somewhere else.\n* **Information Silos:** Databases become \"orphaned\" and forgotten, leading to outdated knowledge.\n\n**My Approach to a Solution: Systems Thinking**\n\nI decided to tackle this not as a software problem, but as a *systems problem*. The goal wasn't just to plot databases on a screen, but to create a visualization that was genuinely useful and intelligent.\n\nMy philosophy was based on two principles:\n\n1. **Intelligent Layout:** The graph shouldn't be a random cloud of nodes. I developed a custom layout engine that uses algorithms inspired by graph theory (like simulated annealing) to actively untangle the connections, minimize line crossings, and reveal the underlying structure.\n2. **Connection Analysis:** Not all relations are equal. The system also needed to analyze the *strength* of connections to identify which databases are true \"hubs\" in the workspace and which are merely satellites.\n\nHere is a look at the dashboard I've been building based on these principles.\n\nAs you can see, the goal is to provide a clean overview of the system's architecture. But a static map isn't enough. The tool is interactive and built for deep analysis. For example, you can:\n\n* **Search and Filter:** Instantly find specific databases by name or property, allowing you to focus only on the parts of the system you need to see.\n* **Isolate \"Orphaned\" Databases:** A key feature is the ability to quickly identify and isolate databases that are not being interconnected, helping you find valuable knowledge that has lost its connection to your system.\n* **Export Your Architecture:** Export the visual map of your workspace to different formats (like PNG or SVG) to include in documentation, presentations, or team reviews.\n\nI'm sharing this deep dive because I'd love to get feedback from other power users on this *approach* to solving the problem. Do these principles resonate with the issues you face?",

Over the past months I poured more than 900 hours into building a system that doesn\u2019t feel like a template anymore \u2013 more like a complete operating system for life and work.\n\nIt\u2019s fully modular, has 4 core hubs (Focus, Health, Finance, Growth), 20+ embedded AI prompts, and more than 1,500 curated visuals to make it actually feel like a designed product. I wanted it to have the clarity and elegance of something you\u2019d expect from an Apple launch, but inside Notion.\n\nThe result is a space where everything connects: projects, habits, meals, workouts, finances, networks, even travel. It\u2019s not about stacking databases, it\u2019s about having one consistent architecture where life just makes sense.\n\nI\u2019m super curious what you all think:\n\u2013 Has anyone else here tried to build something that ambitious in Notion?\n\u2013 Do you think there\u2019s a future where Notion becomes more of a platform for full ecosystems rather than just templates?\n\nHappy to share a look behind the scenes if there\u2019s interest. \ud83d\ude80\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/TastyStudios",

I built a very minimal Notion template to keep us motivated and track our progress. Three times a week we complete the session and log our results, and whenever someone submits a session, Notion notification automatically pings the whole group. It\u2019s a simple example of group progress tracking in one shared Notion template. Note: Almost everyone never used Notion before.\n\nOf course, you can adapt it for any other purposes\u2014the only limit is your imagination!  \nTrack other challenges, study sessions, reading, or any habit you\u2019re building with friends and family.\n\nJust wanted to share the idea here (if you are interested in my challenge template, it can be found [here](https://www.notion.com/templates/6-week-challenge-journey-w-friends-fitness-edition))  \nI got my habit tracking formulas from [Notion Template Marketplace \u2014 Search results for advanced habit tracker](https://www.notion.com/templates/advance-habit-tracker)  \nHere is more info about the push-up program: [The Hundred Pushups Training Program](https://hundredpushups.com/)",

          "selftext": "Ever hit the trail, only to realize you forgot something essential? Me too.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to keep track of all the little trinkets required for backpacking. To keep organized, I built a simple Notion\u00a0[inventory tracker](https://www.notion.so/Backpacker-Inventory-256547554d7480e8aa89c5b6b5487168?pvs=21), which I\u2019m sharing here in case it\u2019s useful to others.\n\n**Goals:**\n\nI wanted this tool to do three things:\n\n1. Track shopping needs\n2. Generate a packing list\n3. Surface notes for upcoming trips\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* The landing page has three databases (**Kit**,\u00a0**Stats**, and\u00a0**Trips**\u00a0\u2014 linked in the bottom right corner) and three filtered views.\n* The\u00a0**Kit**\u00a0database stores the inventory, with each item\u2019s category, weight, and quantity. Checkboxes track whether an item is\u00a0*on hand*,\u00a0*worn*, or\u00a0*packed*.\n* If an item is not\u00a0*on hand*, it appears in the\u00a0**Shopping List**.\n* If an item is not\u00a0*packed*, it appears in the\u00a0**Packing List**.\n* The\u00a0**Trips**\u00a0database stores trip records with fields for start/end dates, mileage, and country. New records follow a simple template with sections for goals, itinerary, and a bullet journal.\n* Trips with a start date this year appear in\u00a0**Upcoming Trips**.\n* The\u00a0**Stats**\u00a0database pulls metrics from\u00a0**Kit**\u00a0and\u00a0**Trips**. Right now, it only calculates base weight by summing all items that are not\u00a0*worn*, but it could easily be expanded to track gear value, total trip spend, or cumulative mileage.\n\n**Initial testing:**\n\nI used this system for the first time while prepping for the Tour du Mont Blanc. It worked! I remembered everything, and when I arrived in Chamonix, I knew exactly what I still needed to buy: a butane canister and lighter.\n\n**Ideas for expansion:**\n\n* Add gear prices in\u00a0**Kit**\u00a0and roll up to total value in\u00a0**Stats**\n* Add expenses in\u00a0**Trips**\u00a0and track total spending in\u00a0**Stats**\n* Track total mileage across all trips in\u00a0**Stats**\n\n**Closing thoughts:**\n\nIt\u2019s simple, but this tool has kept me more organized than anything else I\u2019ve used. Here\u2019s the\u00a0[template link](https://www.notion.so/Backpacker-Inventory-256547554d7480e8aa89c5b6b5487168?pvs=21)\u00a0again if you want to give it a spin \u2014 curious how others would tweak or expand it.\n\nHappy trails!",

Honestly, there\u2019s no way to learn everything in just one day or even a few days. It\u2019s a skill you develop little by little by time.\n\nI always say just start, that\u2019s exactly how I did it. I started small, databases were something I never implemented at the beginning. I played with checklists, pages, columns, and images, and tried to make everything look as aesthetic as possible. Then I started learning more by watching Notion dashboard tours or tutorials, and practicing on my own dashboard. Practice is key so practice, practice, practice and apply what you learn to your own templates. Next time you find a template you like, try to understand how it\u2019s structured and replicate small parts in your own, never copy, but make it suitable for your own needs and style. Play with it, and make it a point to learn a new feature each time.\n\nThese are some of my favorite creators who make tutorials about Notion \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n- Creative cove https://youtube.com/@creative_cove?si=cct2vNhvZRz5D6Dq\n\n- Red Gregory https://youtube.com/@redgregory?si=6oGG7TBiZkaJHuQL\n\n- Thomas Frank Explains https://youtube.com/@thomasfrankexplains?si=asn1yMxITKc43yOV\n\n- Better Creating  https://youtube.com/@bettercreating?si=BWa9e_CCNPLzhFu5\n\n\nIf you have any other tips or favorite Notion creators, leave them in the comments so we can all get inspired and tell me in what area do you want to get better at, its formulas for me \n",

Look at the post live on my site!\n\nDone.\n\nThat's the entire workflow.\n\nFor my brain, everything in Notion is published and if I want to edit anything published, that's where I go.  \nEverything in Obsidian is a draft and if I want to brain dump or write a rough outline, it happens there.  \nIt's a really clean mental separation.\n\nBUT and this is the biggest part for me personally, when I want to edit a live blog post, which often happens (I'm more of a \"publish it and then make it better over time\" type than a \"good enough and forget about it\" type) I just open Notion, use the database search to quickly find the post, make the edits, and it's done.\n\nIf I'm doing a lot of edits, I can uncheck the checkbox in Notion to pause syncing on that post and then recheck it when I'm finished.\n\nNow for the explanation of how and why I got here.\n\nFocus is hard and friction often breaks mine.  \nI have boxes of notebooks and hard drives of folders of almost complete but not shipped research and writing.\n\nProductivity hacks are more entertaining than effective when you're neurologically atypical like me.\n\nMy attention shifted to curiosity about how my brain works and what works for my brain.  \nOne standout thing has been this: tools and environment make more of an impact than goals.  \nHow doing the work feels is significant. More significant than the result. This is probably due to my very limited working memory. But regardless, it's true, at least for me.\n\nSo while there are a lot of tools out there that could help me work faster or automate things, they generally had a net negative impact on my overall throughput.\n\nBecause I would get the work done \"efficiently\" but then be mentally exhausted and end up following mindless and meaningless rabbit trails while attempting to reengage in the next work to be done.  \n(Side note: AI is awfully good for this.)\n\nThe automations and tools were adding cognitive load. This applies both within and outside of Notion. Taxing my very limited working memory further. Creating lots of little friction points from switching tabs and windows or clicking five times to get to the next item to edit.\n\nNotion has always almost been a great place for me to work.\n\nThe benefits being the editor UI and database with pages inside concept.\n\nThe two main problems being milliseconds of friction everywhere and the feeling that working in Notion meant working on copies of things instead of the things themselves. Just like Word and Docs before, everything still had to be copied and pasted somewhere else to be \"live\".\n\nRecently I've been doing more of my writing in Obsidian.  \nConsidering a full move away from Notion.  \nBut separately and simultaneously looking for a CMS and website setup to handle blog publishing in a minimal, works-for-my-brain way.\n\nNo code tools and automations have been a no go for me, because something about them feels fragile and more like a quest than a problem solving tool.\n\nAs it turns out, you don't have to build a workflow with an automation tool like n8n or make to connect Notion to Webflow CMS. You can connect the actual Notion blog database to the Webflow CMS collection using Whalesync. With this setup, Notion is the CMS, Webflow the site builder/host, and Obsidian where I write my drafts.\n\nAnd that is what I have done.\n\nNow I get the instant responsiveness of Obsidian for writing.\n\nWith the formatting (simply pasting images and markdown) and fluid editing of Notion. But instead of needing to copy and paste everything out of it, I just click and un-click a single checkbox.\n\nThe weirdest part to me is that on paper, I'm still copying and pasting drafts from Obsidian into Notion, so there shouldn't be any actual gains from a productivity point of view, and yet it FEELS completely different. Maybe it's because Notion is an easy to access, nicely formatted place to paste into?\n\nNow I'm looking for other non-obvious anti-patterns to apply.\n\nDo you have any to share that I could try?",

Sure, Google Translate can convert text, but what about turning academic papers into podcast scripts, or transforming technical documentation into marketing copy? That's where things get interesting.\n\nRecently discovered this game-changing workflow using Skywork (a multilingual LLM with strong content transformation capabilities) combined with Notion API and Python scripts. The setup reads my research database pages and intelligently transforms content - for example, turning a dense English research paper into a conversational Chinese podcast outline, complete with cultural references and simplified explanations. It maintains all the Notion formatting, tags, and relationships while completely reimagining the content for the target format and audience. What used to require hiring different writers for different markets now happens automatically in about 5 minutes per piece.\n\nThe whole automation has been a lifesaver for my content strategy across different platforms and languages. I'm curious - what's your biggest challenge with content adaptation in Notion? Are you manually rewriting everything for different audiences, or have you found creative ways to automate content transformation beyond simple translation?\n\nThe whole automation has been a lifesaver for my content marketing workflow.

Most of my meetings are scheduled through Google Calendar and often include meeting links and recurring events.\n\nI\u2019m trying to pull these calendar events into Notion, but it looks like Notion has trouble syncing recurring events from Google Calendar.

I would think that there should be a way to have the Google Calendar events imported directly into the Notion Database, but can't seem to find the settings. Would love to hear how others are handling it.\n\nEdit: Quick note, looking for a solution that doesn't involve subscribing. Currently unemployed recent graduate so I don't have the funds for that.",

The only time data leaves is if you use the AI features.\n\n# Who it\u2019s for:\n\n* **Students**: grab quotes and build study notes quickly\n* **Researchers**: collect citations across tabs without losing them\n* **Writers/Marketers**: save snippets of inspiration, trends, or examples\n\n# \ud83d\udd39 Looking for feedback\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from this community:\n\n* **What tools do you use for clipping / saving text during research?**\n* **Would features like auto citation (APA/MLA) or direct Notion integration be useful?**\n\nI\u2019m currently launching early access, you can check it out at\u00a0[**selectsynth.me**](http://selectsynth.me/).\n\nThanks for reading, and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts \ud83d\ude4c",

I made it because I wanted to track my expenses better after moving abroad, and since I already use Notion for everything (tasks, finances, even memories), it felt natural to bring this there too.\n\nThe tool does a few helpful things:\n\n* Fetches your expenses from your bank account and adds them to Notion automatically, in a smart way\n* Categorizes expenses and income automatically (using both keywords and sentence transformers for semantic matching)\n* Converts currencies to USD (or any currency you want) with real-time exchange rates (and falls back to cached rates when needed)\n* Works across multiple accounts, not just one\n* Easily integrates with any Notion database structure!\n\nIt\u2019s built with FastAPI, uses [TrueLayer](https://truelayer.com) for secure banking access (works with most EU/UK banks), and Notion\u2019s API to push the data. \n\nCategorization is done with some logic + sentence transformers, so even vague or weird descriptions still get sorted decently well. I'm trying not to bloat the project too much \u2014 I want to keep it a simple, focused tool \u2014 but I'm always open to suggestions or small improvements.\n\nIt\u2019s still a work in progress and I\u2019m fixing things as I go, but it works. I run it once a day using\u00a0[Make.com](http://make.com/), but you could easily hook it up to cron, GitHub Actions, or anything else.\n\nHere\u2019s the repo if you're interested!  \n[**https://github.com/riwaht/notion-revolut-server**](https://github.com/riwaht/notion-revolut-server)\n\nIf you use Notion for budgeting, this might be something you\u2019d find useful. And if you want to adapt it to your setup and need help, I\u2019d be happy to chat, feel free to DM or reach out:\n\n* Email:\u00a0[Gmail](mailto:riwa.hoteit@gmail.com)\n* LinkedIn:\u00a0[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riwa-hoteit-7236b6204/)\n\nLet me know what you think or how you\u2019d improve it! :)",

Personally, I prefer building dashboards for myself since everyone\u2019s workflow is unique, though inspiration from others helps.\n\nWhat I\u2019m curious about is:\n\nFor those selling, are you actually earning, or are these templates mainly things you made for yourself and listed just in case someone buys?\n\nIf you are earning, how much are you making right now / in total, and how much experience did it take to get there?\n\n\nAlso, I feel like an underrated angle is building Notion setups for businesses as freelance projects. That seems like it could have strong demand, but I don\u2019t see it discussed much. Is that because there\u2019s less demand, or simply fewer people offering it?\n\nWould love to hear some insights.",

I experimented by building some apps to see how much I could push it and what kinds of use cases it could realistically solve.\n\n**Different ways to use Notion as a backend,**\n\n* **Directly via Notion API:** Read/write data from your Notion databases into your custom-developed app. Works best if you want an app, customized and fully integrated into your existing tech stack.\n* **No-code tools** (like [NotionApps](https://www.notionapps.com/), [Super](http://super.so/), etc): Build apps using a drag-and-drop tool that is in sync with Notion pages and databases. Great for lightweight business apps like client portals, internal dashboards, or field apps. \n* **AI Developer platforms** (like [Replit](https://replit.com/)): Vibe code your app while the platform takes care of the Notion integration. Great if you\u2019re up for experimenting, are flexible with design, and don\u2019t want to manage all the code yourself.\n\n**Some real limitations,**\n\n* **Performance:** Notion wasn\u2019t built for high-frequency queries or complex relational operations. Large databases or apps requiring real-time updates experienced lag or slow responses.\n* **Reliability:** The API has rate limits, and Notion itself can experience occasional downtime. For mission-critical apps, it won't be reliable.\n* **Data structure:** Notion databases need to be carefully designed, especially relations and rollup properties. Messy or inconsistent databases can quickly break your app workflows.\n* **Security:** Notion\u2019s permission system is not equivalent to user auth of your app. For managing user access and sensitive data, you will either have to code your own auth layer or use a no-code tool that handles it. \n\n**Sanity checks if you take this route,**\n\n* Keep your databases clean and structured with relations\n* Scope your use case; it will not work if you have a million rows of data.\n* Test rate limits, plan for batching requests for high-frequency operations.\n* Manage permissions and authentication using a no-code tool or by custom coding.\n* Version control and track schema changes, as even small edits can disrupt your app.\n\n**Final verdict:** Notion can serve as a simple back-end for lightweight business apps, but if you\u2019re trying to build a product with lots of logic, scale, or real-time needs, it is better you use traditional databases and sync data to your Notion.\n\nHave you tried using Notion as a back-end?

If not in the know, it's ...a lot.  \n  \nFirst of all:  Perforated Bovine!  This ai tool created a well fleshed out database for this purpose, integrating the lion's share of possible data points and with features that *I didn't ask for* but are intuitive and I eventually would have added in myself.    I had done a search prior to see if anyone had done this for Notion previously, with no results. When I saw the option for the AI prompt, I figured why not try and it popped out a gem, without being given anything other than the name the game. \n\nThis old nerd is impressed. \n\nTo my question, while I understand that I can tweak this manually, I'd like to keep exploring what this little hickey can do.   Is anyone aware of a way to recall the AI  prompt that generated a project in Notion? As I was just fooling around initially, I don't remember exactly how I phrased it and I'd prefer not to have to start over.  Might be overthinking this.   \n",

Spend hours/days tweaking Notion to fit my workflow perfectly\n2. Use it enthusiastically for a few weeks/months\n3. Gradually stop engaging with the complex setup\n4. End up just using it as a glorified knowledge database\n5. Get fed up and start over with a new setup\n6. Repeat infinitely\n\n**My biggest gripes:**\n\nNotion is simultaneously too powerful and too finicky. The customization options are overwhelming, but more importantly, things constantly break or don't show up because I missed some obscure filter setting or database property. I'll be looking for a note I KNOW exists, only to discover it's hidden because of some view configuration I forgot about.\n\nIt *could* be perfect, but it's not. The gap between potential and reality is maddening.\n\n**What I actually want (and what's inevitable):**\n\nA truly intelligent, zero-setup productivity system. Something that:\n\n* Automatically summarizes my meetings and schedules follow-ups\n* Reminds me of tasks based on context from my emails/messages\n* Tracks projects without me having to build elaborate database schemas\n* Just... works without constant maintenance\n\nRight now I'm experimenting with ChatGPT Projects as a super basic version of this vision. I dump everything into it and get contextually aware responses based on my evolving knowledge base. No setup, no maintenance, just intelligence.\n\n**The bottom line:** I'm done with apps that require me to become a database administrator just to track my life. The technology exists for something better - we just need someone to build it.\n\nAnyone else feeling this Notion fatigue? What are you using instead?",

          "selftext": "I've been deep in Notion for a couple of years now\u2014it's my go-to for personal brainstorming, quick wikis, and organizing random thoughts. But as my freelance work scaled up with a small team and actual clients, things started to get messy. I feel like I am losing control\n\nMy Tasks are scattered across databases, and deadlines that I have to manually chase because notifications feel hit-or-miss. Team chats mixed with emails and external tools, clients emailing for updates because sharing a Notion page feels too raw and unprofessional. No easy way to track time, generate invoices, or keep everything transparent without constant manual tweaks. My workspace is now this tangled web\u2014personal notes are just wreaked into business stuff, nested toggles hiding \"sub-things\" that I forget exist, and everything just... misaligned. It's giving me that same vibe as the \"absolute sh\\*t show\" posts I've seen here, where you think you're organized until you zoom out and see the labyrinth.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Notion's flexibility, but for full-on project management, it feels like it's trying to be everything and ending up stretched thin. What I really crave is a setup where projects, teams, and clients are all together and aligned, without the constant fighting against the interface.\n\nLike:\n\n* A unified project dashboard that gives a centralized view of everything\u2014tasks, resources, real-time updates, and key metrics\u2014so I can make quick decisions without digging.\n* Milestone and deadline tracking that's intuitive, not hacked together with properties.\n* Task prioritization and custom statuses to fit how my team actually works.\n* Centralized team communication to kill off scattered emails and chats\u2014real-time feedback, mentions, notifications, all in one hub.\n* An integrated client portal for seamless updates and transparency, so clients feel in the loop without me sharing my whole Notion chaos.\n* Real-time project updates and comprehensive reports with clear dashboards for better decision-making.\n* Seamless app connectivity and integrations (like API stuff) to pull in data from other tools without breaking the flow.\n* Automated time tracking, effortless invoice generation, and payments handling.\n* Board and task views, document/file management, messages\u2014basically, everything in one place with a clean, aesthetic UI that doesn't stutter or lag.\n\nIs Notion handling all this smoothly for you in team/client scenarios? Or are you patching it with Zapier hacks, external apps, or just suffering in silence? I've tried PARA and other systems, but it always spirals back to overload.\n\nI just want to ask that would solution exist for something like this on notion? I will i need to get 3d pary softwares that are better at doing this? for example this [clcik](https://www.teamcamp.app/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=2025q3_1) and there are 50 more that I SAW JUST TODAY\n\nWhat are your go-to hacks or alternatives when Notion falls short for this? Share your wins (or horror stories)\u2014maybe it'll save my sanity!\n\nTL;DR: Notion rocks for solo stuff, but team/client project management is turning mine into a nightmare.",

I was wondering if people think I can get away with the free version for now or the plus is worth the money.\n\nThanksss",

I don\u2019t care about a unified inbox or seeing all my mail in one place\u2014I just want the AI tools available on all my accounts.\n\n**Notion\u2019s solution:**\n\nEvery inbox you want to use with AI has to be added as a \u201cmember\u201d to your workspace. In Notion-speak, \u201cmember\u201d = \u201cperson.\u201d So for me to use AI in all my inboxes, I\u2019d need to pay for *each* as a full membership. That\u2019s an **extra** $72/month, just so inboxes I personally manage can all use the AI features.\n\nWhen I tried to clarify this with support (multiple times), they kept telling me how to add accounts or warning me that \u201cunified inbox\u201d isn\u2019t available (which I never asked for).\n\n* Why is every inbox treated like a separate employee? Who thought that made sense for anyone managing multiple businesses or roles?\n\n* How is this pricing structure even remotely competitive with other premium email tools?\n* Why is it so hard to get a straight answer from support about a basic business workflow?\n\nHonestly, the whole experience has been so confusing and tone-deaf that I\u2019m rethinking my commitment to Notion. Has anyone else run into this? Has anyone found a workaround or a plan that doesn\u2019t treat every inbox as a unique human?\n\nI would be thrilled to hear if I'm misunderstanding something here. \n\nAlso, if you hate the AI features, in the spirit of not yucking someone else's yum, please don't respond.

  "comprehensive_report": "# COMPREHENSIVE NOTION ANALYSIS REPORT\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report analyzes over 500 Reddit posts from r/Notion to extract key user sentiments, feature requests, competitive insights, and strategic opportunities for Notion. The overall sentiment is mixed, with users highly engaged and passionate about the platform's flexibility and template ecosystem but also expressing frustration regarding bugs, usability issues, missing features, and inconsistent pricing. The report identifies significant competitive threats from specialized productivity tools, platforms with more robust automation and integrations, and those with superior mobile experiences. The strength of the community and the template ecosystem are key differentiators that should be nurtured.\n\nA critical finding is that while Notion is powerful and customizable, this often leads to complexity and a steep learning curve, especially for new users. This presents an opportunity for competitors offering simpler, more opinionated solutions. Furthermore, several core functionalities such as database management, recurring tasks, and offline mode, are plagued with bugs and usability issues, leading to user frustration and churn risk. Another significant area of concern is Notion's AI integration, where users feel there are gaps and expect more advanced capabilities. In contrast, the template ecosystem and the level of customization that it allows are the key strengths.\n\nBased on this analysis, the report recommends prioritizing bug fixes and performance improvements, especially on mobile and for core features like databases and recurring tasks. Furthermore, investments in enhancing native integrations, simplifying complex features, and expanding learning resources are crucial. Strengthening the template ecosystem and clarifying pricing strategies will further improve user satisfaction and retention. This analysis also includes a competitive analysis of ZenFlo, highlighting opportunities for ZenFlo to capitalize on Notion's pain points by focusing on simplicity, AI-powered assistance, and a focus on mindful productivity.\n\n## WHAT USERS LOVE ABOUT NOTION\n\nAnalyzing positive sentiment and praise, the following aspects of Notion emerge as highly valued:\n\n- **Top 5 most appreciated features/aspects:**\n    1.  **Flexibility and Customization:** The ability to build custom workflows and systems is a key draw, particularly for power users creating personal \"operating systems\".
