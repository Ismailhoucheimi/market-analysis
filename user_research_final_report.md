# **II. Key Themes & Insights**

## **A. The "All-in-One" Value Proposition and Simplicity**

- **Strong Appeal for Consolidation:** 
Users are enthusiastic about a unified platform that combines task management, notes, and AI assistance, reducing the need to switch between multiple applications. Ruth Leach stated, "I think it's brilliant. I think it's very useful for someone who's having to switch to different apps all the time. So if you've got everything in one place, like, that's literally what I need, because I'm on Fathom and then I have to go to my Google Docs, and then I have to go to ChatGPT and then I'm like switching all the time." Nillah Jones called ZenFlo a "gold mine" because it "literally has everything."

- **Preference for Simplicity over Complexity:** 
Several users, notably Namira Wicaksana, Dana Mosleh, Pratham Sharma, and Ruth Leach, found tools like Jira, Notion, and ClickUp overwhelming due to excessive customization or "so much information thrown at you at once." They appreciate ZenFlo's "simple, like clean aesthetic" and "straightforward" approach. Pratham Sharma explicitly said, "It is not overwhelming. Not too many options right on right off the start." This validates the assumption that users find other tools overwhelming.

- **Onboarding is Crucial:** 
The initial learning curve of Notion was a significant deterrent for Dana Mosleh, and Pratham Sharma felt overwhelmed by Notion's complexity for beginners. This underscores the importance of a smooth and well-explained onboarding experience for ZenFlo.

## **B. AI Features: High Potential, Usability Gaps, and Trust Concerns**

- **AI Planner is a "Star Feature":** 
The AI Planner consistently garnered high praise for helping users overcome the "blank page" problem and initiate new projects or study plans. Namira Wicaksana "definitely see[s] myself using this because that's exactly how I started learning JavaScript." Dana Mosleh was "really impressed with this because like I'm the kind of person who finds starting something new like a blank sheet very daunting." Nillah Jones called it a "gold mine" for entrepreneurs. Users also envision using it beyond new project creation, for any instance of facing a blank page.
- **AI Reschedule for Bulk Actions:**
While initially skeptical ("I'm a control freak," said Namira Wicaksana), users found AI Reschedule useful for bulk actions like mass due date changes or priority shifts, as long as they retained ultimate control. Isabella would use it "often due to frequent workflow changes."
- **AI Summary and Recommended Actions:**
Generally appreciated for quick overviews and reminders (Isabella: "it's more for a reminder... a short summary"). However, some users (Dana Mosleh, Iqra Jawed) found it "too text-heavy" and "overwhelming," desiring a collapsible option for recommended actions or more succinct output. Nillah Jones valued its "honest feedback" without emotional bias, boosting her confidence.
- **Contextual AI Chat is a Game Changer:**
Martin Tejeda identified the combination of Kanban boards and the ability to "talk to tasks" (contextual AI chat) as "very powerful" and something he would "even pay for." He envisions an "omnipresent" AI assistant that understands the current screen context. Dana Mosleh also validated the need to "talk to Flo... specifically about this task."
- **AI Model Clarity and Customization:**
Users (Namira Wicaksana, Ruth Leach, Pratham Sharma) struggle to differentiate between AI models (e.g., "fast," "powerful") and need clearer explanations or use-case examples. The helper text "stick to default if you don't know what to select" was confusing.
- **AI Tones are "Extra":**
AI character tones (e.g., "pirate," "Gen Z," "Kawaii") were largely dismissed as "a bit extra" or "too specific" for work contexts (Pratham Sharma, Ruth Leach). Namira Wicaksana raised concerns about cultural insensitivity with "Kawaii."
- **Trust and Confidentiality Concerns:**
Dana Mosleh and Ruth Leach expressed significant confidentiality concerns about AI accessing work data, particularly regarding data sharing with third parties or competitors. They require explicit, legally binding terms ensuring data is "purely for internal purposes." Ruth also wanted a "validate" or "show sources" button for AI chat replies to increase confidence.

## **C. Task and Project Management**

- **Clear Task Prioritization and Views:**
Users value clear categorization of tasks (High Priority, Deadlines, In Progress) on the dashboard (Namira Wicaksana, Dana Mosleh). Dana suggested "Upcoming Deadlines" for clarity. Many users (Dana Mosleh, Isabella) appreciate both Board and List views for project-specific tasks.
- **Need for Proactive Reminders:**
Martin Tejeda and Nillah Jones desired proactive, "intrusive" AI-driven reminders (e.g., text messages, phone alerts) for urgent or colliding tasks, moving beyond passive dashboard displays. Nillah stressed this for procurement work to prevent "major financial losses."
- **"Plan" Feature is Highly Useful:**
The "Plan" feature in the Progress Report is seen as "highly useful for bridging the gap between individual tasks and a cohesive plan of action" (Namira Wicaksana, Isabella). Dana Mosleh also saw value in historical plans for performance comparison.
- **Improved Task Creation and Organization:**
Users want more flexibility in task organization. Leib Moscovitz requested recurring tasks. Courtney Taylor wanted task templates with dependencies for recurring processes and the ability to track task duration from creation to completion. Namira Wicaksana requested that tasks created from AI replies default to the attached project and offer options for subtasks or independent tasks.
- **Project Context Visibility:**
Users like Namira Wicaksana and Courtney Taylor want to see the associated project for each task within the "Plan" view and dashboard task overview for better context.
- **Customization in Kanban/List Views:**
Courtney Taylor wants custom Kanban columns (e.g., "waiting," "blocked") and pre-filtered, collapsible list views grouped by status. Iqra Jawed also desired "Active," "Archived," and "Completed" states for projects, not just tasks.
- **Attachments and Mobile Accessibility:**
Dana Mosleh and Leib Moscovitz emphasized the importance of attaching files to tasks and projects. Kene Arete strongly highlighted the critical need for a mobile version of ZenFlo for cross-device accessibility, stating he "would likely not use it" without it.

## **D. User Experience and Design**

- **Visual Aesthetics and "Fun":**
Dana Mosleh, a designer, found Notion's "visual fun" (icons, headers, avatars) appealing and wished ZenFlo was "more visually interesting to make her excited about using it." Pratham Sharma found ZenFlow's button color scheme "okayish" and noted performance differences compared to Notion.
- **Clarity in UI Elements:** 
Several users pointed out confusing UI elements:
    - AI Summary not clearly linked to Recommended Actions (Namira Wicaksana).
    - Difficulty identifying "complete task" action from the status tag (Namira Wicaksana).
    - Lack of clear text input box for AI chat (Ruth Leach).
    - Confusing icons for "supports images" and "supports web search" (Ruth Leach).
    - Red color used for both "high priority" and "overdue" tasks (Iqra Jawed).
    - Red error icon on overdue tasks looking like a "field error" (Iqra Jawed).
    - Misleading "chat options" icon in AI planner prompt box (Iqra Jawed).
- **Whitespace and Readability:** 
Iqra Jawed consistently critiqued the application's "lack of white space" and "too much text," especially on the dashboard and project screens. Nillah Jones found the default font size too small.
- **Task Selection Screen Issues:** Iqra Jawed found the task selection screen for creating a plan "overwhelming" with no sort, filter, or "select all/deselect" options. Courtney Taylor also struggled to discern project affiliation for tasks on this screen.
- **Inconsistent Color Coding:** 
Iqra Jawed pointed out "color clashes" and inconsistencies in color usage for task statuses across different screens.
- **Naming Conventions:**
Iqra Jawed found "AI Planner" confusing, clashing with the "Plan" feature on the dashboard, suggesting "AI Project Creator" instead.

- [ ]  **Implement clear, concise instructional content** and tooltips throughout the onboarding process to guide users without overwhelming them, directly addressing the "perfectionism trap" and time wasted on figuring out tools.

## 3. Dashboard

### **Top Praises**

- Users find the **default organization of tasks** on the dashboard (such as "High Priority," "Deadlines," and "In Progress") to be **intuitive and highly useful** for quickly understanding what needs attention.
- The **"Plan" feature** within the Progress Report is considered **highly useful for bridging the gap** between individual tasks and creating a cohesive plan of action.
- The **AI Summary** is valued for providing an **overarching perspective on task and project status**, including positive feedback, identifying areas for improvement, and offering motivation. It acts as a **helpful reminder and a short summary** of tasks and activities for quick checks.
- Users appreciate the **visual nature of the progress report** (e.g., arrows for "to do" and "completed") for a quick, at-a-glance understanding of task status.
- The existence of **both a holistic and individual project dashboard** is seen as valuable, allowing for both broad overviews and focused work.
- Seeing **progress and achieving "mini achievements"** through completion tracking and progress bars is highly motivating for users.

### **Top Pain Points**

- A significant and recurring pain point is that the **AI Summary is "too text-heavy" and "overwhelming"** upon opening the dashboard, making engagement difficult, especially for users with conditions like ADHD. One user critiqued its design, stating it felt more like **"the back of a book where you have an abstract" rather than a dynamic, actionable dashboard**.
- Users initially **didn't realize the AI Summary and the Recommended Actions were related**, perceiving them as disconnected until explained.
- The **task selection screen for creating a "Plan" is overwhelming** due to a large number of tasks that require manual scrolling and selection. It **lacks essential features like sort, filter, and "select all/deselect" options**.
- Confusion exists around the **"Complete" button for a plan**, with users suggesting it should **automatically mark a plan as complete** once all tasks are done (100% progress), rather than requiring manual action for an incomplete plan.
- Users struggle to **discern which project each task belongs to** within the "Plan" task selection list and the dashboard's task overview (3 buckets), hindering context.
- **Confusing UI elements** include: difficulty understanding how to "complete" tasks from the status tag (missing chevron in task card in task overview); the use of the **color red for both "high priority" and "overdue" tasks**, leading to ambiguity; and a **red error icon on overdue tasks** that looks like a "field error" rather than an overdue status.
- The **"Overall" progress report is found unintuitive in its current location** (a drawer on the right side). Some would like to see it more prominently.
- One user expressed a strong need for **proactive, "intrusive" notifications for urgent or colliding tasks** (tasks due at the same time), especially crucial in time-sensitive work like procurement where a missed notification can lead to "major financial losses".
- One user expressed that the progress report feature is more suitable for work related tasks as he sees it as "over engineered" for personal tasks, which he prefers to manage with simpler methods like sticky noted.
- **AI Tone Features are "Extra" or Insensitive:** AI character tones (e.g., "pirate," "Gen Z," "Kawaii") were largely dismissed as **"a bit extra" or "too specific" for work contexts** (Pratham Sharma, Ruth Leach). Namira Wicaksana raised concerns about **cultural insensitivity with "Kawaii"**.

### **Areas for Further Research**

- **Dashboard Layout and Prominence**: Validate with more users whether the "Plan" and "Overall" tabs should be more prominent than the AI Summary on the dashboard, as one user suggested the AI Summary could take up smaller real estate.
- **Customization of Progress Report**: Explore user interest in having choices to sort or filter progress display by project, task, assignee, etc.

- **Automatic Recurring Tasks in Plans**: Further research is needed to determine if users would find value in the AI automatically identifying and including recurring tasks in weekly plans.
- **Historical Plan Access**: Validate the desire for a history or archive of past weekly plans to enable performance comparison and identification of recurring procrastinated tasks.

### **User Ideas, Suggestions, and Feature Requests**

- **Collapsible AI Summary & Succinct Output**: Implement a collapsible option for the recommended actions within the AI Summary, and explore making both the summary and actions more succinct and visually appealing to reduce text density.
- **Emphasize "Plan" and "Overall" Tabs**: Make the "Plan" and "Overall" tabs within the Progress Report more prominent on the dashboard, possibly by giving them more space or a more central location.
- **"Completed Tasks" Section**: Add a new category or card for **"completed tasks within a week's time"** to the dashboard overview for users to track recent progress and derive motivation.
- **Proactive AI Reminders**: Introduce AI-driven proactive reminders, such as text messages or phone alerts, for urgent or colliding tasks, to move beyond passive dashboard displays and prevent overdue items. These notifications should be "intrusive" when critical.
- **Intelligent Task Selection for Plans**: Implement enhanced sort, filter, and search options for the task selection screen when creating a plan, with the long-term potential for a chatbot feature to intelligently select tasks.
- **Automatic Carry-Forward**: Develop an "intelligent system" feature to automatically **carry forward incomplete tasks from a past plan to a new one**, reducing manual workload.
- **Customizable Dashboard Buckets**: Allow users to customize dashboard buckets and the overall view, enabling them to include elements like a "completed" section for motivation and to create high-level summaries for managers.
- **Project Context in Task Views**: Ensure that the associated project for each task is clearly visible within the "Plan" view and dashboard task overview for better context.
- **"Create Tasks" Button in AI Summary Modal**: Add a **"Create tasks" button directly within the AI summary modal** for a smoother user flow, allowing users to create tasks immediately after reviewing the summary.

### **Next Steps**

**Quick Wins (Low-hanging Fruit):**

- [ ]  **Implement a collapsible feature for the recommended actions** within the AI Summary to address the "too text-heavy" pain point.
- [ ]  **Redesign the "Complete" button for plans** for better clarity, possibly by renaming it to "End Plan" when a plan is not 100% complete and clarifying if plans auto-complete when all tasks are done.
- [ ]  **Address the confusing use of the color red** for both "high priority" and "overdue" tasks by differentiating their visual cues.
- [ ]  **Add "Select All" and "Deselect" options** to the task selection screen when creating a plan.
- [ ]  **Ensure project context is visible for tasks** in the "Plan" view and dashboard task overview (e.g., showing the project name next to each task).
- [ ]  **Work on making the AI Summary and recommended actions more succinct** to reduce the perceived overwhelming amount of text.
- [ ]  **Increase the default font size** for improved readability on the dashboard.
- [ ]  **Clarify "Change Status" UI**: Implement a clearer visual cue, such as **adding an arrow inside the status tag**, to indicate that tasks can be changed or more specifically completed directly from the dashboard's task overview.

**More Complex Items:**

- [ ]  **Redesign the AI Summary's overall presentation** to be less text-heavy and more actionable, exploring alternative visual formats such as carousels, summary cards, or progressive disclosure.
- [ ]  **Enhance the task selection screen for plans** by adding filtering, sorting, and search capabilities, and consider the long-term strategy of integrating a chatbot for intelligent task selection.
- [ ]  **Implement an "automatic carry-forward" feature** for incomplete tasks from previous plans to new ones.
- [ ]  **Re-evaluate the prominence and placement of the "Plan" and "Overall" tabs** on the dashboard, potentially making them more central or allocating more screen real estate, given their high perceived value.
- [ ]  **Explore extensive customization options for dashboard buckets and progress reports**, allowing users to personalize their view, include motivational elements like a "completed tasks" section, and generate high-level summaries for managerial reporting.
- [ ]  **Investigate implementing progress tracking within tasks** (e.g., a visual indicator like a pie chart for 50% completion) for motivational purposes and as a useful metric for managers. Assuming this would only work if a task has subtasks (Trello-style).
- [ ]  **Consider adding a dedicated card or section for "completed tasks within a week's time"** to the dashboard overview for quick progress tracking and motivation. Perhaps this can be a hidden option.
- [ ]  **Allow users to choose between seeing their progress either by projects or tasks.** However, the progress by tasks is more important here since that is he mental mode the user is already in, which is why it should be the default view.

## 4. Projects

### **Top Praises**

- **AI Planner is consistently a "star feature"** and "gold mine" that helps users overcome the daunting "blank page" when starting new projects or study plans. Users, like Namira Wicaksana, can "definitely see myself using this because that's exactly how I started learning JavaScript". Dana Mosleh was "really impressed with this because like I'm the kind of person who finds starting something new like a blank sheet very daunting". Nillah Jones called it a "gold mine" for entrepreneurs, offering new perspectives on project planning. Courtney Taylor found it helpful to "get the ball rolling" and "break down the process" for new, complex tasks or projects, providing a starting point.
- Users appreciate the **ability to edit and delete AI-generated projects and tasks**, finding it useful that tasks are already outlined with the option to add more.
- The **default organization of tasks (High Priority, Deadlines, In Progress) on the dashboard is intuitive and highly useful**. Dana Mosleh found the ability to see project-specific tasks in both Board and List view highly important.
- The system allows for **creating new custom categories or tags for projects**, which is important for users whose work may involve different or evolving categories.
- The **current card view for projects is "well arranged," and the ability to filter projects by tags** helps users see relevant tasks and progress.
- **Project-specific chat and notes are highly useful for maintaining context**, enabling focused communication and information gathering directly within the project. One user also highly valuedd **having separate notes within a project view**, preferring it over Notion's approach.

### **Top Pain Points**

- **Misleading AI Planner Naming:** The name **"AI Planner" is confusing because it clashes with the existing "Plan" feature** on the dashboard where users create plans manually. Iqra Jawed suggested a different name like "AI Project Creator" to avoid ambiguity.
- The **default prompt suggestions for the AI planner are too generic** and do not provide strong examples for testing its capabilities, lacking specific and exhaustive examples like "plan a trip" or "organize a party". Additionally, suggestions like "Learning" and "Reading" are considered too general and more suited as individual tasks unless they form a comprehensive "learning path".
- **Inconsistent Project Definitions:** Courtney Taylor finds that many productivity tools, including Microsoft Planner, are designed around **"projects" when her work is better categorized as "areas of responsibility,"** indicating a mismatch in how work is conceptualized.
- **Lack of Project Status Clarity:** Iqra Jawed feels there's a **need for a clear distinction between "Archived" projects (on hold, deferred) and "Completed" projects (finished)**, wanting a separate "Completed" status to track past successes and for end-of-year reflection and reporting.
- **Visual Design Issues:** Project descriptions are sometimes seen as unnecessary, and their **current display with partial text and no whitespace is not an optimal use of space**. Iqra Jawed found the red error icon on an overdue task confusing, as it looked like a "field error" rather than an overdue status.

### **User Ideas, Suggestions, and Feature Requests**

- **Advanced AI Planner Capabilities:**
    - **Expand AI Planner Use Cases:** Some users claimed they would use the AI Planner primarily for getting started when faced with a blank page, not necessarily just for new project creation.
    - **Contextual Input for AI Planner:** Martin Tejeda would feel more willing to use the AI Planner for complex work projects if he could **"upload" documents, videos, or even web links to provide context**, rather than having to type everything in.
    - **Specialized AI Knowledge:** Nillah Jones suggests the **AI should have specialized knowledge based on the user's "career"** (e.g., procurement, financial auditor) to provide more relevant and in-depth assistance for projects.
    - **Smart Prompt Suggestions:** AI planner prompt suggestions should be "smart" and personalized based on the user's existing projects or identified role.
    - **Enhanced "Attach Document" Feature:** The "attach document" feature for the AI planner is considered "excellent" but currently "hidden". It should be more visible and its functionality (e.g., "import documents from existing sheet/FigJam/Google Doc") clearly described.

- **Contextual AI Assistant for Projects:** 
Martin Tejeda expressed a strong desire for the **AI chat assistant to be "omnipresent" or "floating" within the project workspace**, providing contextual assistance (e.g., asking questions about high priority tasks directly from the Kanban board) without requiring navigation to a separate chat tab. This would allow for discussing individual projects, not just tasks.

### **Next Steps**

## 5. Tasks

### **Top Praises**

- **AI Reschedule is Valuable for Bulk Actions**: Users, initially skeptical, found the AI Reschedule tool very useful for performing **bulk actions** like mass due date changes or priority shifts. Isabella specifically noted she would use it "often due to frequent workflow changes".

### **Top Pain Points**

- **Lack of Proactive Reminders for Urgent/Colliding Tasks**: Users, particularly in time-sensitive fields like procurement, expressed significant frustration when the system **fails to provide proactive, "intrusive" notifications (e.g., text messages, phone alerts)** for urgent or colliding tasks. Nillah Jones emphasized that this can lead to "major financial losses". Martin Tejeda also needed alerts outside of ZenFlo for high-priority tasks with close deadlines.
- **Confusing Visual Cues for Overdue Tasks**: The use of a **red error icon** on overdue tasks was found confusing by Iqra Jawed, who perceived it as a "field error" rather than an overdue status. She also considered the additional tooltip for overdue tasks redundant with the red highlighting. Dana Mosleh also noted confusion between "High Priority" and "Deadlines" because both could be perceived as "high priority".
- **Difficulty with Task Completion (ADHD-related)**: Courtney Taylor, who has ADHD, struggles significantly with prioritizing tasks (seeing "everything as a high priority" and "due yesterday") and with maintaining interest to finish tasks, often getting sidetracked by perfectionism or new tasks.
- **Default Font Size Too Small**: Nillah Jones found the default font size in ZenFlo initially **too small to read**, requiring her to zoom in.

### **Areas for Further Research**

- **Proactive AI Reminders**: Validate with more users if having **push notifications or phone alerts** for urgent or colliding tasks is a critical need, especially in fast-paced work environments.

This proposition would motivate users to utilize Zenflo's AI chat, as it offers access to models they might otherwise pay for or encounter usage restrictions with in free versions.

### **Top Pain Points**

- **Unwanted Paid Features:** Iqra Jawed believes that image generation (if we decide ot go for it) is a niche feature primarily for designers, and most users should not have to pay for it as part of a general productivity tool.

### **Areas for Further Research**

- **Integration with Client-Facing Work Platforms:** It is important to **validate with more users** if it might be the case that some users are stuck using apps like notion, clickup, asana, etc and that they don’t really have a say in the matter (dictated by their jobs). So maybe, allowing Zenflo to have integrations with such tools (if possible) is not a bad idea. This way they can use Zenflo alongside those tools.
- **AI-Powered Email Management and Communication App Integration:** We should investigate user interest in **AI-powered features for email management**, such as reminders to reply or generating replies, and the integration with **official communication apps like Outlook or Gmail** to centralize information and minimize app switching.
- **Image Generation as an Optional Add-on:** If image generation is considered for Zenflo, it should be explored as an **optional add-on feature**, ensuring that users who do not need it are not burdened with unnecessary costs.
- **Native Features as Deal Breakers for Premium Subscriptions:** It would be valuable to **validate with more users** if Zenflo's **native features** (beyond just access to AI models) are the primary "deal breaker" for paying for premium, as suggested by Pratham Sharma. This indicates a need to ensure the strength of core Zenflo functionalities.

### **User Ideas, Suggestions, and Feature Requests**

- **Organization of External Links and Content:** Explore how Zenflo's notes or AI features could help users **organize external links and content for later consumption/digestion**.
- **Integration with Official Communication Apps:** Implement integrations with official communication apps like **Outlook or Gmail** to centralize information and avoid users switching between applications.
- **AI for Email Management:** Introduce **AI-powered features for email management**, suchating reminders to reply or automatically generating replies.
- **Apple Calendar (iCal) and Calendly Synchronization:** Develop the capability to sync Zenflo's calendar with **Apple Calendar (iCal)** and **external booking systems like Calendly** to create a more integrated scheduling experience.
- **Granular Google Calendar Synchronization and Color-coding:** Add options for users to **sync with *selected* Google Calendars** rather than all of them, and to **display Google Calendars in their original colors** to facilitate distinguishing between different events.

### **Next Steps**

**Quick Wins (Low-hanging Fruit):**

- [ ]  **Implement Granular Google Calendar Sync and Color Display:** Develop the options to allow users to **sync with only *selected* Google Calendars** and to **display Google Calendars using their original colors**. This would provide more control and improve the visual differentiation of events.
- [ ]  **Clarify Premium Value Proposition:** Actively emphasize in marketing and onboarding materials that Zenflo Premium provides **unlimited access to powerful AI models** (such as ChatGPT and Gemini Pro) that users might otherwise pay for or encounter usage limits with in free versions. This directly addresses a key motivation for users like Nillah Jones.

**More Complex Items:**

- [ ]  **Develop Client-Facing Platform Integrations:** Prioritize research and planning for **integrations with client-facing work platforms**. This acknowledges that users may be required to use other tools and would benefit from Zenflo working in tandem with them to streamline their workflow.
- [ ]  **Explore AI Email Management Capabilities:** Conduct in-depth research and begin development on **AI-powered email management features** (e.g., generating replies, setting smart reminders for emails) and comprehensive integrations with major email platforms like Outlook and Gmail.
- [ ]  **Ensure Native Features Drive Premium Value:** Continue to heavily invest in and refine Zenflo's **native features**, ensuring they are compelling and robust enough to be the primary reason users subscribe to the premium offering. This is crucial as core platform functionalities are a "deal breaker" for some users, as highlighted by Pratham Sharma.
- [ ]  **Implement Robust External Calendar Integrations:** Plan for comprehensive integration with **Apple Calendar (iCal)** and **external booking systems like Calendly** to offer a truly all-encompassing scheduling and time management solution within Zenflo.
- [ ]  **Strategize Image Generation as an Optional Add-on:** If the development of an image generation feature is pursued, it should be designed as an **optional add-on** to the premium subscription. This approach would ensure that users who do not require this specialized functionality are not charged for it.
